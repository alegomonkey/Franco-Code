Thus, although the title suggests otherwise, it is a story that unfolds primarily within the history of British North America and the United States rather than the new Canadian nation-state. Although cast in large part as an exploration of questions raised by a literature concerning the presence or absence of capitalism in rural North America, Craig's study offers valuable insights to those who have little patience with the transition debate and who believe that wading into that quagmire simply generates more mud(dle).""","Bitterman, Rusty",,,2010 May,,en,,,,Journal Article,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/636583523"">636583523</a>",1780-1875,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0008-3755,,,The Canadian Historical Review,http://utpjournals.metapress.com/content/g16280u02kr1/?sortorder=asc,91,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/d09f7150113d9870e03ad66ffe64076e.jpg,Acculturation and Assimilation;Aroostook County ME;Business and Economics;Canada;Criticism and Review;Demography;Emigration and Immigration;Farming and Agriculture;Forestry;Fur-trading;Labor History;Maine;Native Americans;New Brunswick;New England;Nonfiction;Nonfiction -- History -- Economic and Industrial;St. John River Valley

16,The Spacing of Births Among French-Canadian Families : An Historical Approach,"From the author: ""This article stresses on two aspects of demography. The first aspect is a historical and geographical analysis of the spacing of births among French-Canadians and the second one is the possibilities of using genealogies as sources of data which can yield demographic information. When official computations are not available, the development of demographic data based on family genealogies may give analysts some indication of past performances within societies. Genealogies thus provide a rich source of  information for both Canadian and American historical demographers. When proper methodological techniques are applied to these data, they yield results which then permit one to draw conclusions about demographic behavior. The data for the  present article are derived from a longer study dealing with historical demographic changes among French-Canadians between 1650 and 1950. The genealogy of one French-Canadian family is the source of information utilized in this report. The paper is intended to contribute additional information on changing patterns of child spacing over time and space.""","Bouvier, Leon F.",,,1968-02,,en,,,,Journal Article,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/226000748"">226000748</a>",1650-1950; Canada; United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0008-4948,,#1,The Canadian Review of Sociology and Anthropology,http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1755-618X.1968.tb01166.x/full,5,,,,,Canada;Demography;Family;Genealogy;Nonfiction;Nonfiction -- Anthropology;Nonfiction -- Demography;Nonfiction -- Social Sciences;Nonfiction -- Sociology;Religion

In other words, if a Franco-American at Level 1 (i.e. that level farthest from standard French) succeeds in raising his speech phonetically to Level 2 (i.e. an intermediate level between Level 1 and standard French), his vocabulary will normally reveal a similar degree of switching to modern French.""","Brault, Gerard J.",,,1961-12,,en,,,,Journal Article,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/481209222"">481209222</a>",1950-1960; New England,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0016-111X,,#2,The French Review,http://www.jstor.org/stable/383710,35,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/49bd855cf5416d38f17e34a0bb6fca63.jpg,Acculturation and Assimilation;Language and Linguistics;Maine;Massachusetts;New England;New Hampshire;Nonfiction;Nonfiction -- Language and Linguistics

49,Franco-American Voices : French in the Northeastern United States Today,"From the author: ""This paper describes the current situation of Franco-American French. The discussion is based on interviews with 275 speakers from eight communities: Van Buren, Waterville, and Biddeford, Maine, Berlin, New Hampshire, Southbridge and Gardner, Massachusetts, Bristol, Connecticut, and Woonsocket, Rhode Island. Our analysis confirms that French has not been transmitted to the youngest generations and that its domains of use are highly restricted. Nevertheless, the majority of speakers still use the language often (18%) if not daily (44%).

51,L'identitÃ© franco-amÃ©ricaine : tendances actuelles dans le sud de la Nouvelle-Angleterre,"De Fox, Fortin, Martin, et Stelling: ""Le terme Â«franco-amÃ©ricainâ€‰Â» sâ€™emploie pour dÃ©signer les immigrants canadiens arrivÃ©s au nord-est des Ã‰tats-Unis pendant une pÃ©riode sâ€™Ã©talant de 1840 Ã  1930. Catholiques et francophones, ils y ont Ã©tabli des communautÃ©s resserrÃ©es et un rÃ©seau dâ€™institutions religieuses, scolaires et sociales afin de maintenir leur religion, leur langue, et leur mode de vie traditionnel. Cependant, lâ€™Ã©volution rapide quâ€™a connue ce groupe depuis les soixante derniÃ¨res annÃ©es a dÃ©clenchÃ© un dÃ©bat sur sa dÃ©finition : comment les Franco-AmÃ©ricains se caractÃ©risent-ils actuellementâ€‰?

MÃªme si un grand nombre d'entre-eux utilisent toujours l'Ã©tiquette franco-amÃ©ricaine pour se dÃ©crire, les Franco-AmÃ©ricains se limitent dÃ©sormais Ã  une conception identitaire qui Ã©volue au sein de leur propre communautÃ© sans rÃ©fÃ©rence Ã  une culture supra-communautaire.""","Fox, Cynthia A.;Fortin, GeneviÃ¨ve;Martin, VÃ©ronique;Stelling, Louis",Texte intégral,,2007-01,,en; fr,,,,Article journal,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/365012401"">365012401</a>",1940-2007; New England,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0007-7720,,#1,Canadian Review of American Studies,http://utpjournals.metapress.com/content/q2p24m84367h1n43/?a=9,37,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/fe06f9777d8b3239c62a6cd8d7300927.jpg,Acculturation and Assimilation;Bristol CT;Community: Customs and Social Life;Demography;Gardner MA;Language and Linguistics;New England;Nonfiction;Nonfiction -- Language and Linguistics;Personal History: Biography and Oral History;Southbridge MA;Woonsocket RI

D'Erudit: ""Le prÃ©sent article a pour sujet la genÃ¨se d'une communautÃ© canadienne-franÃ§aise en Nouvelle-Angleterre, celle de Lewiston, Maine, avant 1880. L'auteur dÃ©crit d'abord la localitÃ© Ã  la veille de l'arrivÃ©e des premiers Canadiens franÃ§ais en I860, s'attardant plus particuliÃ¨rement aux bouleversements causÃ©s par la RÃ©volution industrielle, qui fit de Lewiston un des plus importants centres textiles des Ã‰tats-Unis. Il explique ensuite la nature des migrations canadiennes-franÃ§aises au 19e siÃ¨cle, et le rÃ´le de premier plan qu'y jouaient la famille et la parentÃ©. De fait, la famille Ã©tait la cellule de base de la communautÃ© ethnique en formation.

58,French Canada's Search for a Homeland : A Literary Perspective,"Gill explores French Canadian societies through the lens of its literatures, particularly those coming from Quebec. He introduces his efforts with a brief illustration of the rise and fall of New France, where he claims that French Canadians have been left in a position of political defeat (whether or not they choose to accept it as such) for almost two centuries, and thus in a constant struggle for survival through the establishment of a political homeland. Up until recently, says Gill, the French Canadian search for such a home has been bolstered by the linguistic, religious, and otherwise cultural principles of ""la survivance,"" and has been crucial to the persistence of Francophone Quebec. Oftentimes, as Gill will also point out, ""la survivance"" has been trumped more confidently by a ""rayonnement,"" or a principal desire to spread one's own culture. We these ideas in mind, Gill traces the French Canadian experiences of political defeat and cultural persistence - the search for and development of a ""homeland"" - through their telling literatures. We see a fallen New France and a rising Quebec through images in fiction.","Gill, Robert M.",,,1978 Autumn,,,,,,Journal Article,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/60621291"">60621291</a>","1600-1970, Quebec in literature",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1943-9954,,#2,American Review of Canadian Studies,http://www.acsus.org,8,,,,,Acculturation and Assimilation;Canada;Criticism and Review;Ethnicity and Collective Identity;Exploration and Colonization;Farming and Agriculture;Fiction and Literature;France;Fur-trading;Government and Politics;Literary Works -- Criticism and History;New England;QuÃ©bec;Religion;War

70,Standards and Local Curriculum : A Zero-Sum Game?,"Function and impact of Maine Learning Results educational plan in elementary schools of rural Maine. Includes a segment on Walters School in the St. John Valley, and discusses its elementary French language program as it becomes incorporated in MLR methods. From the author: ""Many rural educators and researchers have not embraced standards-based reform warmly. Some are wary of standards driving out unique and locally responsive curriculum. Others cast standards as one more example of a reform largely geared toward urban and suburban schools but foisted on rural schools regardless of applicability. These arguments are mostly rhetorical. Few studies have looked at the effects ofstandards' implementation on the classroom practices of rural educators. In this paper, I examine the impact ofa state standards-based reform, the Maine Learning Results, on curriculum and instruction in four rural schools. I focus on the impact that standards have on locally responsive curriculum in the schools. I suggest that state standards and locally responsive curriculum ultimately may not be as incompatible as many scholars and practitioners suggest.""","Jennings, Nancy E.",,,2000 Winter,,,,,,Journal Article,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/425331644"">425331644</a>",1990-2000; Maine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8756-0534,,#3,Journal of Research in Rural Education,"http://www.jrre.psu.edu/articles/v16,n3,p193-201,Jennings.pdf (full text available here)",16,,,,,Education;Language and Linguistics;Maine;Midcoast Region ME;Nonfiction;Nonfiction -- Education;Quarry Island ME;Scofield ME;St. John River Valley

From census data, it will be shown that two-thirds of Canada's population live in English dominated regions, within which minorities of all other languages are dwindling through assimilation, but that there is also a French Canada, within which it is the use of the English language that is declining.

Rather it is a symbol of French Canadian culture adopted during the period between the 1880s and 1930s when French valley residents were eager to assert their â€œFranco-Americanâ€ identity. The Madawaska twin barn displays some affinity to American barns in Aroostook County and particularly the Yankee symbol, the connecting barn. However, its appearance is also French Canadian. The distribution of the twin barn defines an area of French Canadian and American interaction which remains distinct.""","Konrad, Victor A.;Chaney, Michael",,,1982 September,,,,,,Journal Article,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/43321549"">43321549</a>","1880-1982, Upper St. John Valley, Maine",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0887-3631,,#1,Journal of Cultural Geography,http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/titles/08873631.asp,3,,,,,Acculturation and Assimilation;Art and Architecture;Ethnicity and Collective Identity;Farming and Agriculture;Forestry;Madawaska ME;Nonfiction;Nonfiction -- Art and Architecture;Personal History: Biography and Oral History;Social History;St. John River Valley

Using data from a New England industrial community, I trace the connection between this transition and the growth and decline of the textile industry, the incorporation of immigrants into a hierarchical production process, and family strategies for allocating productive and reproductive labor. While the era of working daughters left the allocation of reproductive labor (housework and child care) intact, the wage work of recent immigrant mothers has had a more profound impact on families by reallocating some of 'women's work.' Nevertheless, many families have continued to maintain an ideology that values the husband's authority, emphasizes respect for parents, and stresses differences between men and women, all of these in the face of considerable changes in actual behavior.""","Lamphere, Louise",,,1986 February,,en,,,,Journal Article,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/482347183"">482347183</a>",1900-1986; Rhode Island,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,#1,,http://www.jstor.org/stable/644590,13,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/917f699210481b980db0a54aacef1d97.jpg,Business and Economics;Demography;Emigration and Immigration;Ethnicity and Collective Identity;Gender and Sexuality;Labor History;Mills and Mill Work;Mossasuck River Valley;New England;Nonfiction;Nonfiction -- History -- Labor and Social;Pawtucket RI;Providence RI;Rhode Island;Weaverton RI;Wierville RI

In examining textual sources through which New England French-Canadians have imagined their affinities and differences in relation to other ethnic groups and nationalities, from the mid-19th century up to the present day (e.g., Tremblay, Beaugrand, Kerouac, Plante, Proulx), an alternative model for the 21st century emerges: a politics of alterity in which an increasingly fragile 'microethnic' memory continues to be rearticulated across linguistic and national borders to serve as a parallel narrative to metropolitan discourses of identity, exceptionalism and survivance.""","Larkosh, Christopher ",,,2006 Fall,,FranÃ§ais and English,,,,Journal Article,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/243540416"">243540416</a>","1850-2006, New England",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1206-0143,,#16,TOPIA: Canadian Journal of Cultural Studies,http://pi.library.yorku.ca/ojs/index.php/topia/article/view/13271 (full text available here),,,,,,Acculturation and Assimilation;Ethnicity and Collective Identity;Language and Linguistics;New England;QuÃ©bec;United States

Hamon envisioned a peaceful conquest of New England by a surplus French-Canadian population, capable of resisting Americanization, laboring in the mills, and farming the countryside.

89,A French-Canadian Education and the Persistence of 'La Franco-AmÃ©ricanie',"From the author: ""The migration of one million French Canadians from QuÃ©bec to the United States between 1840 and 1940 was different from the migrations of other ethnic groups. The proximity of QuÃ©bec made possible the maintenance of intimate social and cultural relationships between emigrants and their homeland.

99,Resisting the Melting Pot : The Long Term Impact of Maintaining Identity for Franco-Americans in New England,"From MacKinnon and Parent - Department of Economics, McGill University: ""In this paper, we look at the emigration of approximately 1 million French-Canadians who moved to the United States, with the bulk of the migration occurring between the end of the Civil War and 1930 and with most settling in neighboring New England. What makes this episode particularly interesting is the fact that the French-Canadian immigrants exerted considerable efforts to maintain their language and to replicate their home century institutions, most notably the schooling system, in their new country. This explicit resistance to assimilation generated considerable attention and concern in the U.S. over many years.... We look at the convergence in the educational attainment of French Canadian immigrants across generations relative to native English-speaking New Englanders and to other immigrants....Additionally, we show that military service was a very important factor contributing to the assimilation process through a variety of related channels, namely educational attainment, language assimilation, marrying outside the ethnic group, and moving out of New England. Finally, when we compare Franco-Americans to French-speaking Canadians of the same generations, it is clear that Franco-Americans substantially upgraded their educational attainment relative to what it would have been if they had not emigrated.""","MacKinnon, Mary;Parent, Daniel",Full text,,2005-06,,en,,,,Journal Article,,1860-2005; New England,,,,,,,,,CIRPEE Working Paper,,63,,,,,05-17,,http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=739627 (full text available here),,,,,,Acculturation and Assimilation;Business and Economics;Canada;Demography;Education;Emigration and Immigration;Ethnicity and Collective Identity;Fall River MA;Holyoke MA;Language and Linguistics;Mexico;New England;Nonfiction;Nonfiction -- Education;Nonfiction -- Immigration;Nonfiction -- Social Sciences;QuÃ©bec;Religion;United States;War

Kerouac's arrested Oedipal narratives and his related myth of Native Canadian ancestry lead to ambivalent identifications with black subjects, who exhibit characteristics that more properly belong to Kerouac's mother. These identifications exhibit a fetishistic play of presence and absence. Accordingly, Kerouac's racechanges are unstable formations designed to consolidate an ethnic minority writer's American national identity, his autochthonous link to a gendered landscape and his volatile sexuality.

102,"Writing as a Form of 'Survival' in Franco-America : Translingualism, Memory, and Identity in Robert B.

American literature in languages other than English engages with this dialogue, though the nature of this engagement is rarely given appropriate recognition in American Studies. As a step towards redressing this neglect, this article focuses on two contemporary Franco-American writers, both third-generation immigrants, Normand BeauprÃ© and Robert B. Perreault, who choose to write in the language of their ancestors, French. In doing so, they not only cope with a pride rooted in la survivance, the ideology that used to define their community, but also attempt to link their narrative to a QuÃ©bec storytelling tradition. In choosing to express themselves in their native French, they try to demarginalize it and to bring their native voice back to the center. Their works also aim at tackling the issue of code-switching, of working with a mixed and impure language â€“ an issue which has forced many Franco-American novelists to write in English rather than in French.""","Pacini, Peggy",,,2006 September,,,,,,Journal Article,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/441582875"">441582875</a>","1970-2006, New England",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1477-5700,,#3,Comparative American Studies,http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/maney/cas/2006/00000004/00000003/art00008,4,,,,,Community: Customs and Social Life;Emigration and Immigration;Ethnicity and Collective Identity;Fiction and Literature;Language and Linguistics;Literary Works -- Criticism and History;New England;QuÃ©bec

In his bestselling autobiographical novel, 'On the Road,' Kerouac splits his ethnic (French) and national (American) sides into two figures, Sal and Dean, to demonstrate the deficits and benefits of both parts of a hyphenated identity. Italian Sal sees himself as the eternal outsider, whereas Dean is America itself. Yet Sal uses his outsider qualities to connect with other outsiders whose 'roots' are beyond the limits of nationhood. And Dean, despite the seemingly endless freedom of his 'routes' across the country, is stuck in old tropes of Americanness that do not afford him new possibilities. Together, they create a vision of America that is full of its own grandeur, while refusing to be insular.","Skinazi, Karen E.H.",,,2009,,,,,,Journal Article,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/630694433"">630694433</a>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0007-7720,,#1,Canadian Review of American Studies,http://www.utpjournals.com/cras/cras.html,39,,,,,Criticism and Review;Ethnicity and Collective Identity;Fiction and Literature;Literary Works -- Criticism and History;Lowell MA;Pawtucketville MA;Travel and Movement;United States
133,Novelists and Ethnicity : Jack Kerouac and Grace Metalious as Franco-Americans,"In this short piece, Richard Sorrell casts early twentieth-century writers Jack Kerouac and Grace Metalious into the timeline of Franco-American ethnic integration. Sorrell attempts to illustrate the relationship between these writers' works and their backgrounds, with many a turbid novel coming out of the struggle between Franco-American identity development and French-Canadian survivance. From Sorrell: ""What possible line could there be between the man who wrote 'On the Road,' one of the founders of the 'beat' generation, and the crass promoter of lurid best-sellers such as 'Peyton Place?' The thesis of this essay is that such a connection can be found in a little-appreciated bond between the two authors, their common ethnic background. Kerouac and Metalious came from a heritage whose basic cultural attributes (maintenance of traditional nationality and religion, and militant defense of conservatism, Catholicism, and the family) seem to be in conflict with the popular image of both writers.""

143,Vermont and the Imaginative Geographies of American Whiteness,"From the author: ""The U.S. state of Vermont is often portrayed as a place where 'race' is of little significance, yet notions of whiteness are central to how the state has been represented and represents itself. A critical analysis of historical and contemporary economies of representation examines how Vermont has been imagined as one of the last remaining spaces of authentic Yankee whiteness while more recently becoming an imagined homeland for particular brands of white liberal politics and social practice in the United States. Narratives of white Vermont identity have often explicitly drawn on oppositions to other forms of whiteness, particularly those associated with the U.S. South, in constructing an image of a comparatively racially benign Yankee whiteness. Recent right-wing discourses have explicitly attempted to construct Vermont whiteness as outside the American mainstream (not least through its discursive association with gay and lesbian sexualities), suggesting a need for geographical work on the (re)configuration of whiteness to reconsider where 'normal' American whiteness is imagined to reside. The examination of the case of Vermont highlights the need for future geographical research to attend to continuities between various territorialized constructions of whiteness as well as contestations within whiteness.""","Vanderbeck, Robert M.",,,2006,,,,,,Journal Article,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/441291955"">441291955</a>","1860-2007, Vermont, United States",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0004-5608,,3,Annals of the Association of American Geographers,http://www.jstor.org/stable/4124437,96,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/9f8cc291db5cd141ba70b680c1f571d0.jpg,Burlington VT;Ethnicity and Collective Identity;Gender and Sexuality;Geography;Government and Politics;New England;Nonfiction;Nonfiction -- Geography;United States;Vermont

While popular imagery associates French Canadian population growth in QuÃ©bec with very large family sizes and with the outmigration of anglophones, no studies currently exist which attempt to measure the relative impact of each factor.

She uses the examples of Lewiston, Maine, and Worcester, Massachusetts, and the different economies therein to ultimately observe the impact of a certain migration on the traditions (oppressive or otherwise) of a people. From the text: ""My argument is twofold: on one hand, for male leaders in these migrant communities, perpetuating traditional ideas about men's and women's contributions to family and society was part of an effort to retain, on a communal level, their distinct identity as a Catholic people of French Canadian ancestry. In contrast, for female migrants, the decision to support traditional gender norms was a more complicated one; many migrant women and their American-born daughters advocated perpetuation of traditional Quebecois understandings of gender not only as a means of defining their place in American society, as Catholic women of French Canadian ancestry, but also to obtain and maintain the benefits and status within the home that these ideals afforded them in the United States.""","Waldron, FlorenceMae",,,2005,,en,,,,Journal Article,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/480449413"">480449413</a>",1870-1930; New England,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1536-0334,,#2,Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies,"http://www.nebraskapress.unl.edu/product/Frontiers,673226.aspx",26,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/a3cef903ccb3d7aec671c78cba4bf61a.jpg,Acculturation and Assimilation;Auburn ME;Community: Customs and Social Life;Emigration and Immigration;Family;Folklore;Gender and Sexuality;Labor History;Language and Linguistics;Lewiston ME;Manchester NH;Mills and Mill Work;New England;Nonfiction;Nonfiction -- History -- Labor and Social;Nonfiction -- Immigration;QuÃ©bec;Religion;Social History;Winchendon MA;Worcester MA

Consequently, working-class violence, rather than being directed at the manufacturer, was directed at the ranks of the unemployed ready to claim their jobs.

It argues that the postcolonial experiences of the former colonies of England and France in the Americas, particularly the United States and French Canada, have been primarily conditioned by their relations to each other and not by their relations to the former colonizing power.

199,"Tool of Acculturation, Outil de Survivance : Education of French Canadians in Holyoke, Massachusetts, 1880-1920 ","From Fliss: ""Motivated to ensure 'la survivance,' the survival of their religion, language, and culture, French-Canadian immigrants established an extensive private Catholic education system ranging from parish elementary and high schools to boarding schools and colleges in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century New England. Of these education levels, parish schools reached the largest number of French-Canadian children. In Holyoke, Massachusetts, French-Canadian survivance efforts centered on the education of their children in French-Canadian parish schools however, the parish school performed a dual role for the French Canadians in the context of their cultural transition in New England. French-Canadian culture pervaded the school day with French as a language of instruction, sisters from French-Canadian orders as teachers, religion and Canadian history in the curriculum, and the observance of traditional cultural customs and celebrations. The French-Canadian immigrant community did not anticipate the schools' second role, that of aiding the acculturation of their children into American society. Although these roles seem to be at cross-purposes, they co-existed in New England until the second half of the twentieth century with the weakening of French-Canadian identity, the shortage of teaching sisters, and the closing of ethnic parish schools. The bilingual and bicultural character of the school day, influenced by both assimilation and survivance strategies, contributed to the development of a Franco-American population in Holyoke....""","Fliss, Susan",Preview,,2007,,en,,,,Thesis/Dissertation,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/222290783"">222290783</a>","1880-1920; Holyoke, Massachusetts",,,,,,,,,,,223,"Orono, Maine",,,,,,"Tool of Acculturation... @ Fogler Library, UMaine",,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/b6a32b8f611dc9fb1ca79e145602b188.jpg,Acculturation and Assimilation;Business and Economics;Community: Customs and Social Life;Education;Gender and Sexuality;Holyoke MA;Language and Linguistics;Massachusetts;New England;Nonfiction;Nonfiction -- Education;Nonfiction -- History -- Labor and Social;QuÃ©bec;Religion

Few community studies exist for Connecticut in this period of rapid change and industrialization. Northeastern Connecticut, which witnessed the disappearance of Yankee homogeneity, remains unexamined. Putnam, with its large immigrant population, is representative of the area, and of many other smaller mill towns in the northeastern United States, and permits a glimpse of the process whereby French Canadians became Franco-Americans....Three questions drive the inquiry. The first question involves overarching issues of change and inherent community tensions and problems: how did Putnam move from a Connecticut Yankee town to a diverse city? Second, how did the immigrant French Canadians maintain their mentality of la survivance while participating in debates critical to the development of the Putnam community? Third, how did the French Canadian presence in Putnam help to broaden the very meaning of what it meant to be American in the mind of the community?""","Fluet, Gregoire J.",,,2002,,en,,,,Thesis/Dissertation,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/56843683"">56843683</a>","1855-1895; Putnam, Connecticut",,,,,,,,,,,454,"Worcester, Massachusetts",,,,,,From French Canadian to Franco-American... @ Google Books,,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/fbc884126b61d00ecdfbafe552019832.jpg,Acculturation and Assimilation;Brooklyn CT;Community: Customs and Social Life;Connecticut;Criticism and Review;Emigration and Immigration;Ethnicity and Collective Identity;Government and Politics;Labor History;Language and Linguistics;Mills and Mill Work;New England;Nonfiction;Nonfiction -- History -- Labor and Social;Putnam CT

From Harmond: ""As this study seeks to show, Massachusetts confronted a dual set of challenges in the post-Reconstruction era.  In the first place, the Irish-Americans and workingmen, provoked by their marginal status, united in a political revolt to obtain greater recognition and benefits for themselves.  From 1878 to 1883 this ethnic-labor insurrection, led by Benjamin F. Butler, was the focus of Massachusetts politics....Secondly, the accelerated tempo of industrial and technological change spawnwed a spirirt of on-rushing materialism which threatened the Commonwealth's traditional business and political mores.  Investors in the newly-developed water gas process, and the electric trolley, for example, resorted to extensive lobbying to secure favors from the legislature.  One result was a series of scandals in the middle and later 1880s endangering the state's relatively high level of public morality....On the whole, Massachusetts met these challenges well. Under the leadership of members of the Yankee establishment, a conservative, but realistic, attempt was made to accomodate the needs of a new day to the Bay State's intellectual and political heritage.""","Harmond, Richard Peter",,,1966,,en,,,,Thesis/Dissertation,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/36608666"">36608666</a>",1879-1893; Massachusetts,,,,,,,,,,,411,"New York, New York",,,,,,Tradition and Change... @ Google Books,,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/ebadb2a85efb3cd3ad1a49c31e828ad6.jpg,Emigration and Immigration;Ethnicity and Collective Identity;Government and Politics;Journalism;Labor History;Massachusetts;Mills and Mill Work;Nonfiction;Nonfiction -- Government and Politics;Nonfiction -- History -- Labor and Social;Social History

209,Phonological Variables in a New England French Speech Community ,"From the author: ""The first section of the present study consists of a historical survey of the Franco-American community, examining those factors, such as the existence of a network of bilingual parochial schools, which were significant for language maintenance efforts. It is observed that French/English bilingualism in New England has seriously declined in the last twenty years, and that organized attempts to provide for its survival are now limited primarily to the state of Maine. The second section of this study specifies the lexical, morphological and syntactic characteristics which distinguish New England French (NEF) from Standard French (SF), based on a corpus of written and oral documents of recent origin. The results obtained are compared with those reported in studies of Canadian French, and in earlier studies of NEF. It is shown that no structural innovations have emerged in NEF which are not also attested in Canadian and other popular varieties of French. The influence of English is primarily restricted to the borrowing of words, but the use of anglicisms is often subject to ridicule. Systematic change in NEF tends to be in the direction of convergence with SF. Synchronically, a continuum of speech style is observed, whose lower or informal levels are characterized by features shared with the French of rural QuÃ©bec, and whose higher or more formal levels are characterized by corresponding features of SF....The third section consists of an analysis of the present state of the phonology of NEF, and is based on a corpus collected in interviews with six informants in Manchester, New Hampshire. Sixteen phonological rules are formulated, defining elements which distinguish NEF from SF. It is shown that some of these features are being lost as NEF incorporates standard elements. Many of these elements which are avoided in formal speech situations by speakers with more exposure to SF, however, tend to occur frequently or predominantly in less formal situations. The sixteen phonological processes are subjected to partial ordering in terms of an implicational scale, according to whether they are more or less resistant to change. It is shown that those processes which entail only superficial (phonetic) differences between NEF and SF are more likely to be retained, while those processes which entail underlying (morphophonemic) differences are more likely to be lost.""","Kelley, Henry Edward",,,1980,,en; fr,,,,Thesis/Dissertation,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/13275797"">13275797</a>","1970-1980; Manchester, New Hampshire",,,,,,,,,,,222,"Ithaca, New York",,,,,,Phonological Variables in a New England French Speech Community @ Google Books,,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/225a5cb1240880b3a93cd2c4ae14e9a6.jpg,Acculturation and Assimilation;Brunswick ME;Caribou ME;Education;Fall River MA;Language and Linguistics;Lewiston ME;Louisiana;Lowell MA;Maine;Manchester NH;New Bedford MA;New England;New Hampshire;Nonfiction;Nonfiction -- Language and Linguistics;QuÃ©bec;Salem MA;St. John River Valley;Woonsocket RI;Worcester MA

Du rÃ©sumÃ©: ""Cette thÃ¨se a pour objet la migration des Canadiens franÃ§ais vers le Michigan de 1840 Ã  1914. Elle s'intÃ©resse de maniÃ©re plus precise aux Canadiens franÃ§ais qui se sont dirigÃ©s vers deux rÃ©gions caracteristiques du dÃ©veloppement industriel de l'Etat, soit la vallÃ©e forestiÃ¨re de la riviere Saginaw et la peninsule miniÃ¨re de cuivre de Keweenaw. Au-dela d'Ã©tablir un profil statistique du mouvement migratoire, cette these cherche a mettre en lumiere la contribution des Canadiens franÃ§ais au dÃ©veloppement socioÃ©conomique du Michigan, Ã  connaitre de quelle facon les Canadiens franÃ§ais se sont adaptÃ©s Ã  la realitÃ© industrielle changeante du Michigan et Ã  identifier les strategies qui furent adoptÃ©es pour y parvenir....Nous posons d'abord comme cadre general d'analyse que la mobilite spatiale des Canadiens franÃ§ais sur le continent nord-americain a Ã©tÃ© sous-estimÃ©e et que cet aspect de la realitÃ© socioÃ©conomique et culturelle des Canadiens franÃ§ais commence Ã  peine Ã  Ãªtre rÃ©velÃ© dans toute sa dimension. L'analyse de leur migration vers le Michigan Ã©claire de maniÃ¨re encore plus Ã©vidente cet aspect et permet d'inscrire ce mouvement migratoire en parfaite continuitÃ© avec la culture de mouvement et de travail qu'ils ont acquisÃ© au fil de leur expÃ©rience de vie et de travail sur le continent. Nous avons d'abord constatÃ© que les Canadiens franÃ§ais ont contribuÃ© de faÃ§on marquÃ©e Ã  toutes les Ã©tapes du dÃ©veloppement socioÃ©conomique et politique du Michigan. Nous avons dÃ©couvert que l'adaptation des Canadiens franÃ§ais Ã  la realitÃ© industrielle au Michigan s'est exprimÃ©e de maniÃ¨re diffÃ©rente dans le marche du travail forestier et dans celui du travail minier. Dans le premier cas, la culture de mouvement, conjuguÃ©e Ã  une longue expÃ©rience de travail dans ce domaine, a fait en sorte que les Canadiens franÃ§ais se sont sentis rapidement Ã  l'aise dans ce milieu et que cette confiance a influencÃ© leur comportement. Que ce soit dans leur communautÃ©, face Ã  leurs Ã©lites ou au sein du marche du travail, l'assurance qu'ont affichÃ©e les Canadiens franÃ§ais leur a permis de prendre une distance face aux prÃ©scriptions clericales visant la survivance et l'isolement, pour participer activement Ã  la sociÃ©tÃ© globale, s'y impliquer, s'adapter et rÃ©agir aux changements majeurs qui sont survenus sur le marche du travail industriel....Dans le secteur minier, l'absence d'expÃ©rience de travail des premiers migrants ne leur a pas permis d'afficher une aussi belle assurance. Les Canadiens franÃ§ais sont dÃ©meurÃ©s en marge du travail minier alors qu'ils se sont concentrÃ©s dans les secteurs connexÃ©s du travail forestier pour lequel ils avaient une expÃ©rience de travail. Ils ont Ã©galement cherchÃ© Ã  s'isoler socialement se concentrant dans des villages comme celui de Lake Linden oÃ¹ ils ont constituÃ© longtemps plus de la moitiÃ© de la population totale et oÃ¹ ils ont pu ainsi maintenir un certain controle sur leur rÃ©alitÃ© socioÃ©conomique et politique....Mais dans les deux cas, les Canadiens franÃ§ais n'ont pas Ã©tÃ© passifs, ni victimes de la situation. Aux changements de toute nature qui se sont produits, ils ont constamment rÃ©agi en faisant appel Ã  leur culture de vie et de travail et aus ressources familiales pour s'adapter afin de faciliter leur integration socioÃ©conomique.""","Lamarre, Jean",,,1996,,fr,,,,Thesis/Dissertation,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/46524973"">46524973</a>",1840-1914; Michigan,,,,,,,,,,,521,,,,,,,La migration... @ l'Université de Montréal;La migration... sur Google Books,,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/fc379e325837a7e5ee3c339405f9716c.jpg,Business and Economics;Demography;Emigration and Immigration;Ethnicity and Collective Identity;Farming and Agriculture;Forestry;Fur-trading;Geography;Government and Politics;Labor History;Michigan;Nonfiction;Nonfiction -- History -- Economic and Industrial;Nonfiction -- History -- Labor and Social;Social History

Aspects of folklore performance and context are considered from the historical point of view of the Lowell Franco-American community....Part II, on the other hand, deals mainly with the documentation of the various realms of Franco-American folk-traditions, here classified according to genre. Traditional narratives (""contes""), popular jokes (""histoires droles""), children's songs and rhymes, and elements of oral history as well as aspects of traditional singing, music and dance are consecutively considered with sample texts of each genre given and analyzed. Further supporting documents are also presented in the appendices....Because Franco-American culture (and therefore Franco-American folklore and popular culture) is the historical result of successive migrations (from France to what is known today as Canada and, from Canada to New England) this study also takes into account the phenomenon of cultural continuity as well as some aspects of the dynamics of culture change which are viewed here as a process resulting from the conflict having taken and still taking place between two opposing forces: cultural maintenance and assimilation....Most of all, however, this work is a first step into the field of Franco-American oral-traditional genres, popular culture and an homage to ethnic creativity.""","Lane, Brigitte Marie",,,1983,,en,,,,Thesis/Dissertation,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/21874384"">21874384</a>","1830-1980; Lowell, Massachusetts",,,,,,,,,,,608,"Cambridge,  Massachusetts",,,,,,Franco-American Folk Traditions... @ Harvard University;Franco-American Folk Traditions... @ Google Books,,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/9541bc86f74a7782d7bdf2e70a6f3e0a.jpg,Acculturation and Assimilation;Bedford NH;Burlington VT;Canada;Community: Customs and Social Life;Emigration and Immigration;Folklore;France;Lowell MA;Manchester NH;Massachusetts;New Brunswick;New England;Nonfiction -- Anthropology;Nonfiction -- Social Sciences;Personal History: Biography and Oral History;Social History;Woonsocket RI

From the author: ""Always among the most numerous groups of immigrants to the United States, until 1969, the British and Canadians seldom claimed the attention of historians, just as they caused little discussion among the American people generally. Sharing a common language and closeness of culture with the Americans, the British and Canadians remained unhyphenated--they were America's 'invisible immigrants.'...A number of important studies on the British immigrant, if not the Canadian, do exist, but they are concerned with the Britons' experiences and their contribution to the American mosaic during America's 'century of immigration,' the one hundred years from 1815 to 1914. The purpose of this study was to extend the record of British and Canadian immigration beyond the statistical reports of government departments since the hiatus of World War I and to present an interpretive commentary on the significance of these two streams of immigration--to the sending countries; to the receiving country; and to a sample of individual immigrants themselves.""","Lines, Kenneth",Full text,,1977,,en,,,,Thesis/Dissertation,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/4232362"">4232362</a>",1920-1970; Canada; Great Britain; United States,,,,,,,,,,,234,"Manoa, Hawaii",,,,,,"<a href=""http://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10125/9870/1/uhm_phd_7723488_r.pdf"">British and Canadian Immigration...</a> @ University of Hawai'i at Manoa",,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/0ca54a1708e959521ed89e2dc21ce62c.jpg,Business and Economics;Canada;Demography;Emigration and Immigration;Ethnicity and Collective Identity;Great Britain;Labor History;Nonfiction;Nonfiction -- History -- Labor and Social;Nonfiction -- Immigration;Personal History: Biography and Oral History;United States

219,Following the Evangeline Trail : Acadian Identity Performance Across Borders ,"From the author: ""The poem 'Evangeline: A Tale of Acadie' by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow published in 1847, has had an impact on people for generations. The success of the poem was felt not only by its readership but also by the Acadian culture that the poem, and its heroine, came to represent. Evangeline, as character and poem, has evolved in meaning and popularity over the centuries and still plays a role in the cultural performance of contemporary Acadians....This study of Acadian cultural identity utilizes a performance approach that looks at cultural identity as a performative accomplishment in daily life. The analysis first enacts a performance historiography of the Acadian Deportation in 1755, Longfellow's poetic representation of this historical event, and the contemporary context of performing Evangeline in the Acadian diaspora. Next it examines the storytelling performances of narrative interviews with five Acadians. Three of these Acadians still live in the land of Evangeline, in Grand-Pre, Nova Scotia, and the other two live in Maine. Retellings of the story of Evangeline and reflections on the poem and character by each of the participants were analyzed for meanings which form and inform contemporary performances of Acadian cultural identity. The performance methodology allows for meanings to emerge from the embodied Acadian storytelling and to contextualize them in cultural and political spheres....""","Pidacks, Adrienne Marie",Preview,,2008-08-00,,en,,,,Thesis/Dissertation,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/314172114"">314172114</a>",1755-2008; Maine; New Brunswick; Nova Scotia,,,,,,,,,,,175,"Orono, Maine",,,,,,http://www.library.umaine.edu/theses/pdf/PidacksMP2008.pdf (full text available here),,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/50575067f284b9fbbffb22797af8fdd2.jpg,Acadians;Aroostook County ME;Ethnicity and Collective Identity;Folklore;Maine;Nonfiction;Nonfiction -- Historiography;Nonfiction -- Social Sciences;Nova Scotia;Performing Arts;Personal History: Biography and Oral History;Poetry;Prince Edward Island
220,"The Status of French Among Youth in a Bilingual American-Canadian Border Community : The Case of Madawaska, Maine ","From Price: ""This study examines the status of the French language among young residents of Madawaska, Maine, a US-Canadian border community with a long history of bilingualism and contact with French speakers. This study views language status as having two distinct yet interrelated components: (1) code role, or characteristics associated with the use of a given language or variety, such as attitudes of speakers toward the variety and its use, the proficiency level of speakers, language use patterns, and so forth, and (2) code nature, or the state of the variety in question in terms of syntax, phonology and lexicon. The data, collected by means of four interview tasks, targeted both code role and code nature and sought to determine the general status of French among the younger residents of this community. In addition to the younger subject population, a small adult baseline population was also included in order to compare data across generations, so as to identify not just possible differences in code role, but also in code nature, including the possibility of language loss....The data suggested several trends. First, in terms of code role, young subjects generally reported lower levels of language use, proficiency and exposure to French than did adults. Secondly, not only did high-proficiency young subjects generally report higher scores in these areas than did lower-proficiency subjects, but males tended to score higher than females in this regard. This would suggest that exposure to French, context, language proficiency and gender correlate with language use among this population. Conversely, attitudes do not generally appear to be a salient factor motivating French language use. With regard to code nature, the study found that even the most proficient young speakers demonstrated some important gaps in their grammatical competence, and that the young subject population as a whole exhibited features in their production consistent with language loss. The study concludes that although there are still many individuals with ability in French, the differences between younger and older speakers in terms of both code role and code nature suggest that local French will be lost unless further action is taken to reverse the progress of French language loss among young bilinguals in the community.""","Price, Joseph Edward",Preview,,2007,,en; fr,,,,Thesis/Dissertation,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/256913741"">256913741</a>","20th century-21st century; Madawaska, Maine",,,,,,,,,,,493,"Bloomington, Indiana",,,,,,The Status of French... @ Google Books,,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/030d2a3384fb730d6a6110c92869b065.jpg,Acadians;Acculturation and Assimilation;Aroostook County ME;Community: Customs and Social Life;Demography;Ethnicity and Collective Identity;Family;Fort Kent ME;Frenchville ME;Gender and Sexuality;Geography;Language and Linguistics;Madawaska ME;New Brunswick;New England;Nonfiction;Nonfiction -- Language and Linguistics;Personal History: Biography and Oral History;QuÃ©bec;St. John River Valley
221,"From Canadien to American : The Acculturation of French-Canadian Descendants in Lewiston, Maine, 1860 to the Present ","Dissertation from the author of ""Loyal but French: The Negotiation of Identity by French-Canadian Descendants in the United States."" From the author: ""Using Lewiston, Maine, as a community study, this dissertation examines how individuals of French-Canadian descent negotiated their entry into U.S. society from 1860 to 2001. Descriptive statistics compiled from federal manuscript censuses, city directories, and naturalization records provide portraits of the community at different points in time. The French language newspaper of Lewiston and materials from Catholic archives provide much of the literary evidence in this work....This study challenges our understanding of what we call ""assimilation."" It suggests that acculturation rather than ""assimilation"" better describes the process by which ethnic populations join the host society. Historians tend to oversimplify ethnic preservation and acculturation by depicting them as binary opposites. This study argues that, rather than struggling between ethnic retention and acculturation, French-Canadian migrants and their Franco-American descendants in Lewiston pursued them as intertwined goals from the 1870s to the 1950s. It also contends that their Americanization was anything but linear. Lewiston's francophones challenged, rejected, or redefined some of the norms of the host society, as they renegotiated their identity in the United States. Yet, modeling good citizenship was integral to their interconnected identity as ethnic Americans. The experiences of Lewiston's French-Canadian descendants challenge contemporary assumptions about the incompatibility of ethnic retention and Americanization.""","Richard, Mark Paul",,,2001,,en,,,,Thesis/Dissertation,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/48260966"">48260966</a>","1860-2000; Lewiston, Maine",,,,,,,,,,,583,"Durham, North Carolina",,,,,,From Canadien to American... @ Google Books,,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/f3177e396cd172ff9722121c0ee614d5.jpg,Acculturation and Assimilation;Auburn ME;Community: Customs and Social Life;Emigration and Immigration;Ethnicity and Collective Identity;Government and Politics;Journalism;Labor History;Lewiston ME;Mills and Mill Work;Nonfiction;Nonfiction -- History -- Labor and Social;Religion;Social History
222,"Exploration of Immigration, Industrialization, and Ethnicity in Waterville, Maine ","From Rowe: ""This paper traces how hegemonic forces create boundaries through the specific examples of the Lebanese and Franco-Americans in Waterville, Maine. These two immigrant groups entered into Waterville after an English-Scottish Protestant majority had already been established in the eighteenth and early nineteenth century. The Franco-American immigration from Quebec extended well over a century and the flow of people out of Canada can generally be studied into two distinct waves. People were constantly coming into Waterville from Quebec, and a small number would return to live in Canada after a time. It is also critical to understand that Franco-Americans were settling all over Maine during this same time span and that it is generally accepted that in the state of Maine today at least forty percent of the state has French-Canadian ancestry. In contrast the Lebanese who came to Waterville came during a very specific time period, from about 1890-1920. Their numbers were smaller and there were very few Lebanese who settled elsewhere in Maine.""","Rowe, Amy E.",Full text,,1999,,en,,,,Thesis/Dissertation,"<a href=""http://digitalcommons.colby.edu/honorstheses/215/"">215</a>","1830-1990; Waterville, Maine",,,,,,,,,,,,"Waterville, Maine",,,,,,Exploration of Immigration... @ Colby College,,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/119542006bc686192c50327440934a55.jpg,Community: Customs and Social Life;Emigration and Immigration;Ethnicity and Collective Identity;Kennebec River Valley;Labor History;Lebanese Americans;Maine;Mills and Mill Work;Nonfiction;Nonfiction -- Anthropology;Nonfiction -- History -- Labor and Social;Nonfiction -- Immigration;Nonfiction -- Social Sciences;QuÃ©bec;Social History;Waterville ME

224,Economic Factors in the Persistence of French-Canadian Identity in New England,"From Schulz: ""French-Canadian immigrants to New England, unlike other ethnic groups in the United States, did not show signs of assimilation into American society until the 1950's. This thesis examines the history of one French-Canadian community - Sand Hill, in Augusta, Maine. French Canadians came to Augusta in great numbers around the turn of the century to work in the cotton mill. To investigate the retention of French-Canadian identity, French-Canadian immigrants are considered as both an ethnic group and a social class. Evidence drawn from interviews with immigrants and from written accounts shows that economic conditions, such as poverty and lack of education, helped to reinforce French-Canadian isolation from ""Yankees"" in Augusta. Resistance to assimilation was also promoted by policies and informal practices of two strong local institutions: the French Catholic Church and the textile mill.""

227,"Living Arrangements : Race, Ethnicity and Nationality in the Liberal State ","From the author: ""Liberals usually argue that cultural identity can flourish in the private sphere but should not matter in public. This argument is blind to the way liberal institutions affect cultural identity, the prejudices that members of some groups face, and the need for there to be only one or two public languages in most modern states. To fill this gap in liberal theory, I divide cultural groups into three: racial, ethnic and national groups. I explore this gap by looking at four groups: American Jews, the Amish, Black Americans and French Canadians....I argue that liberal citizenship transforms ethnic identity, making it difficult though not impossible to maintain strong ethnic ties in the liberal state. I defend these effects on ethnic identity, though I also argue that there is often too much pressure on ethnics to give up their particular practices. Liberal citizenship, though, has not transformed the identity of the Amish, who maintain their identity through a voluntary radical separation from the rest of society. The Amish treasure hierarchical and patriarchal illiberal values, but liberal toleration means that the liberal state should do little about this. Black Americans also have a distinctive culture, not from voluntary separation, but as a consequence of racism. For Blacks to gain equal citizenship, the liberal state must work to make Black citizenship visible and allow Blacks to bypass the effects of racism. This is contrary to the usual liberal argument of making issues of identity private matters. If Blacks gain liberal citizenship their identity would change considerably, just as liberal citizenship has transformed ethnic identity....Many people claim their cultural identity is tied to a particular language, yet most languages have a hard time surviving in industrialized, liberal states. I explain the conditions that languages need to survive. I contend, paradoxically, that because liberalism transforms ethnic identity, liberalism increases the importance of language to the identity of some. While liberalism and nationalism are usually antagonistic, I sketch out a compromise between language-based nationalism and liberalism. I end the dissertation by pointing out the implications my argument has for educational policy and for liberal theory.""","Spinner, Jeffrey Alan",,,1992,,en,,,,Thesis/Dissertation,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/30073134"">30073134</a>",20th century; United States,,,,,,,,,,,338,"Ann Arbor, Michigan",,,,,,Living Arrangements... @ Google Books,,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/f653586b50156be2ff7245b49fbfbf9b.jpg,Acculturation and Assimilation;African Americans;Canada;Ethnicity and Collective Identity;Government and Politics;Jewish Americans;Language and Linguistics;Nonfiction;Nonfiction -- Government and Politics;Religion;United States

In this dissertation, I explore morphosyntactic variation and the advance of language shift in the two locations using historical documentation, U.S. census figures and sociolinguistic interviews conducted with sixty-nine informants....After comparing and contrasting the sociolinguistic profiles of the two communities, I describe some of the linguistic consequences of the shift from French to English in these traditional Franco-American centers through a quantitative variationist analysis of two morphosyntactic variables.

229,"Migration, Family, and Gender : A Longitudinal Analysis of French-Canadian Immigrants in Lowell, Massachussetts, 1900-1920 ","From Takai: ""'Migration, Family, and Gender: A Longitudinal Study of French-Canadian Immigrants in Lowell , Massachusetts , 1900-1920,' explores migration from French Canada to a New England urban centre of the textile industry, Lowell, Massachusetts. During the period under study, both QueÌbec and New England underwent significant socioeconomic transformation. This work analyses the impact of these changes on the process of migration and settlement. It also sheds light on the diverse ways in which French-Canadian men, women, and children responded to new realities in an urban industrial society. In order to investigate these issues, it is necessary to consider this migration as a phenomenon which consisted of a series of processes and not as a linear progression towards inevitable assimilation or Americanization. It is also crucial to emphasize the importance of introducing a gendered perspective in order to recognize the diversity of strategies devised by immigrant men and women as well as the cooperation and tensions they experienced in the process of migration and settlement....This thesis joins recent scholarship in criticizing a perspective that has described all immigrant behaviour as necessarily reflecting one set of culturally predetermined norms and customs. Contrary to the stereotyped image of French Canadians as immobile and fatalistic habitants, evidence from this study shows that they were a highly mobile people for whom migration was a pondered response to the structural changes that were radically reshaping QueÌbec and New England societies. It is argued that the behaviour of Lowell's French-Canadian immigrants in the early twentieth century did not merely reflect the cultural transplantation of habitant values, but also the attempts of working-class immigrant families to survive and cope with significant socioeconomic transformation occurring to both QueÌbec and New England. The diversity in the recorded patterns of movements on the part of French Canadians is indicative of their strategic autonomy and flexibility in adjusting to new socioeconomic realities....This study also seeks to redress a major gender imbalance in the historical studies of immigrants by devoting considerable attention to women. Not only did women's lives differ from those of their male counterparts; there was also great variation in the extent to which women assumed financial and domestic tasks. Such diversity, I assert, in the patterns of women's paid work was defined not only by age or marital status, but also by a combination of factors such as household organization, living arrangements, and the availability of child care. Immigrant families harboured complex interpersonal dynamics where different and, at times, conflicting interests had to be negotiated in not necessarily equal terms, but in accordance to each member's power and authority within the family and the larger society.""","Takai, Yukari",,,1999,,en,,,,Thesis/Dissertation,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/46428729"">46428729</a>","1900-1920; Lowell, Massachusetts",,,,,,,,,,,332,"MontreÌal, QueÌbec",,,,,,"Migration, Family and Gender... @ Google Books",,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/59757db746a7c63599acdaed3805b6fc.jpg,Acculturation and Assimilation;Business and Economics;Community: Customs and Social Life;Death and Disaster;Demography;Emigration and Immigration;Ethnicity and Collective Identity;Family;Gender and Sexuality;Geography;Illness;Labor History;Lowell MA;Massachusetts;Mills and Mill Work;New England;Nonfiction;Nonfiction -- History -- Labor and Social;Nonfiction -- Immigration;QuÃ©bec;Social History;St. Lawrence River Valley

252,What Became of Them and Other Stories from Franco-America,"Ledoux has woven a tapestry of vignettes all coming to a seam at self-reflection. 'What Became of Them' is a collection of short stories that spans a century of Franco America, its cultural mutations, and its burdening self-absorption. Ledoux finds a way to unite spousal estrangement, Catholic suppression, working-class embarrassment, and the tragedy of leaving things behind in a sometimes less-than-latent nostalgia for those things that could have been; he breaks it all down in his characters’ even stronger drive to move forward. “Whenever I stopped using other people’s words,” Ledoux’s young seminarian character muses on prayer, “there was always a stillness, a withered silence.” Ledoux takes this point to heart and, in this collection, subverts it – breaking the withered silence with hopes and fears of a cultural sort little heard in literature.  “The artist is a priest,” says Ledoux’s same character: a priest anew. And so is Ledoux here, writing out prayers of a bold and freeing kind, in a language audible to a world in- and outside of Franco America. Contains the following stories: Germaine (also featured in Puckerbrush Review, le Canado-Americain, Le F.A.R.O.G.

253,Why Kerouac Matters : The Lessons of On the Road,"Critical study of Jack Kerouac's ""On the Road"" through the lens of its author and one of its main characters.
From Viking Press: ""In 'Why Kerouac Matters,' John Leland embarks on a wry, insightful, and playful discussion of the novel ['On the Road'], arguing that it still matters because at its core it is a book that is full of lessons about how to grow up. Leland's focus is on Sal Paradise, the Kerouac alter ego, who has always been overshadowed by his fictional running buddy Dean Moriarty. Leland examines the lessons that Paradise absorbs and dispenses on his novelistic journey to manhood, and how those lessons about work and money, love and sex, art and holiness still reverberate today.

255,The Miracle: A Novel,"From Grove/Atlantic Press: ""John L’Heureux has been acclaimed as '[a] master storyteller . . . elegant, cunning, and wickedly funny' (The Washington Post). Now, in a pitch-perfect, deeply satisfying work of fiction, he enters the world of an unorthodox young priest whose faith is put to the test. Father Paul LeBlanc is young, handsome, and charismatic. He has just been transferred out of Boston because of his dangerous ideas on sex, marriage, and birth control—and because he just doesn’t uphold the decorum expected of a young priest. Exiled to a summer beach community, he looks after elderly Father Moriarty, an unlikely saint who, on the edge of death, is beginning to question his belief in God. Father LeBlanc goes on preaching his edgy homilies, making his efficient way on the path to sanctity. Then Rose Perez and Annaka Malley enter his life, looking, each in her own way, for answers. When, for no reason, a miracle occurs—a dead girl is brought back to life before his eyes—Father LeBlanc finds his faith and his vows, his reason, his life itself, all called into question, leaving him with nowhere to turn. Witty, profound, and deeply moving, 'The Miracle' explores the way God meddles in our lives...and to what end. It examines with great wisdom and gentle insight how best man can serve his spirit. 'The Miracle' is John L'Heureux’s finest, most daring novel.""

263,Candles on Bay Street,"A Fort Kent, Maine, novel by author K.C. McKinnon (a pseudonym for the writer Cathie Pelletier). From Fantastic Fiction: ""In 'Candles on Bay Street,' K. C. McKinnon immerses readers in the rhythms of small-town life in Fort Kent, Maine, a close-knit community that finds many of its most cherished beliefs thrown into question when a hometown girl returns after a long absence. The narrator is Sam Thibodeau, the town veterinarian, whose world is turned upside down when his childhood friend and lifelong crush, Dee Dee Michaud, comes back to town. Dee Dee was always the town flirt, a beautiful, boisterous girl whose spirit couldn't be contained by such a small community. After high school she'd roared off in a sleek Corvette 'the color of the sun' at the side of Bobby Langford, the kind of guy who looked great behind the wheel of a flashy car. Resettling in Fort Kent years later with her son Trooper--the mysterious Bobby having disappeared long ago--Dee Dee starts a candle-making business and soon acquires an avid local following. But why, in the midst of reunions with old friends and a successful business start-up, does she seem so distant? What secret is she keeping from everyone who holds her dear? In this exquisitely crafted, ultimately uplifting novel, K. C. McKinnon beautifully captures the poignance of growing older, the comforting joys of friendship, and the glories of love in its many guises.""

This richly textured novel tells a story of sex and longing, love and loss, and of the deceit that can lie at the heart of family relationships. Set in California, 'Liars and Saints' follows four generations of the Catholic Santerre family from World War II to the present. In a family driven as much by jealousy and propriety as by love, an unspoken tradition of deceit is passed from generation to generation. When tragedy shatters their precarious domestic lives, it takes astonishing courage and compassion to bring them back together. By turns funny and disturbing, irreverent and profound, 'Liars and Saints' is a masterful display of Maile Meloy's prodigious gifts and of her penetrating insight into an extraordinary American family and into the nature of human love.""","Meloy, Maile",,Simon and Schuster,2003,,English,,,,Book,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/50591256"">50591256</a>",,,,,,,,,,,,260,"New York, New York",,,,,,"Official website of Maile Meloy  http://books.simonandschuster.com/Liars-and-Saints/Maile-Meloy/9780743244350  http://books.google.com/books?id=gT7R23fCCD4C&dq=liars+and+saints,+meloy&source=gbs_navlinks_s (limited preview available here)",,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/40719b78348bef68dedefbcfbf164efc.jpg,California;Death and Disaster;Family;Fiction and Literature;Literary Works -- Fiction;Religion;Youth

301,Accordion Crimes,"A startlingly inclusive selection of a century's worth of American immigrant vignettes tied together by the movement of a single accordion. For immigration studies, it is a portrayal attentive in sentiment and beckoning in its concern for the new American. For Franco American studies, its chapter, ""Hitchhiking in a Wheelchair"" (p. 145), is startlingly poignant, and touches the reader at the precise point where cultural amnesia begins. For fiction writing, it is a great effort from a wonderful storyteller. Proulx won the 1999 Pulitzer Prize and National Book Award for her novel, ""The Shipping News."" From Simon & Schuster: ""E. Annie Proulx's 'Accordion Crimes' is a masterpiece of storytelling that spans a century and a continent. Proulx brings the immigrant experience in America to life through the eyes of the descendants of Mexicans, Poles, Africans, Irish-Scots, Franco-Canadians and many others, all linked by their successive ownership of a simple green accordion. The music they make is their last link with the past -- voice for their fantasies, sorrows and exuberance. Proulx's prodigious knowledge, unforgettable characters and radiant language make 'Accordion Crimes' a stunning novel, exhilarating in its scope and originality.""

As militiamen and voyageurs, their sons and sons-in-law travel thousands of miles inland by way of the western rivers and Great Lakes....During this period of rapid exploration and extension of the Canadian frontiers, a marked increase in fur exports brings great wealth to France. There develops a struggle for control over the western territories, Hudson Bay trading posts, the Newfoundland and Acadian fisheries, pitting English colonies and the five Iroquois nations against Nouvelle France, Acadia, and their native allies. Meanwhile, British King William III of Orange and French King Louis XIV vie for political, religious, and military dominance in Europe and North America.""

The story is related through the coming of age of his nine children, from 1919 to 1937, with flashbacks to the youthful premarital years of Louis and his future wife Cecile...Papa Martel, a contract carpenter who travels throughout Maine for work, fills his children with stories of Acadie, their ancestral homeland, in a sense binding his family to the much larger 'family' of French in North America.""

Amy’s passion is for the 19th-century poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, whom she sees as a romantic and tragic figure. Her immersion in the poet’s life and writings is partly fueled by her grandfather’s tales of his ancestors and of the injustice of 'le grand dérangement,' when the French Acadians were expelled from their home in Nova Scotia in 1775....Amy has steeped herself in the lore of the period, and the efforts of a young English teacher to draw her out through hypnosis brings unexpected results...""

Rooted in a changing, dying culture, and a community with a complex history, her mixed heritage held good and bad. With coal black eyes, Indian hair, French language, and woman-centered culture, she inherited a legacy of oppression and denial overshadowed by the powerful influence of the Catholic Church. But Touchette chose a different legacy for her children and the seven generations to follow that connected her to 5000 years of Jewish traditions, and milleniums of Native American spirituality.""

338,"Postcolonialism in North America : Imaginative Colonization in Henry Thoreau's ""A Yankee in Canada"" and Jacques Poulin's ""Volkswagen Blues""","Also featured, in abridged form, in the Massachusetts Review (see 'Journal Articles'). From the author: ""This thesis introduces the concept of imaginative colonization in postcolonial literary and cultural studies, which has a particular relevance to the literatures of North America. It argues that the postcolonial experiences of the former colonies of England and France in the Americas, particularly the United States and French Canada, have been primarily conditioned by their relations to each other and not by their relations to the former colonizing power. Imaginative colonization occurs when one former colony, using the means of the cross-border narrative and/or the postmodern recuperation of history, reimagines another not as an autonomous cultural entity, but as a feature of its own history, language, ideology, and even cartography. Focusing especially on Henry Thoreau's travelogue, 'A Yankee in Canada' (1866) and Jacques Poulin's postmodern novel, 'Volkswagen Blues' (1984), but taking into account the entire history of French Canadian-American relations, this thesis establishes that the practice of imaginative colonization in North American literatures is parallel but nonsynchronous: both American and French Canadian literature go through the same developmental stages of decolonization and postcolonial imaginative colonization, even though they do so in different centuries. The examples presented also indicate that imaginative colonization blurs the established dividing lines between works of fact and fiction and that it occurs in both French and English.""","Weisman, Adam",,,1995,,en,,,,Thesis/Dissertation,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/34361480"">34361480</a>",1750-1995; Canada; United States,,,,,,,,,,,263,"Cambridge, Massachusetts",,,,,,Postcolonialism in North America... @ Google Books,,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/5b9b9ef0d052c665f9ec7bd8db718961.jpg,Canada;Criticism and Review;England;Ethnicity and Collective Identity;Fiction and Literature;France;Government and Politics;Literary Works;Literary Works -- Criticism and History;QuÃ©bec;United States
339,The Dogs of March,"The first piece of Hebert's ""Darby Series"" - five novels set in a fictional town in rural New Hampshire. From University Press of New England: ""Howard Elman is a man whose internal landscape is as disordered as his front yard, where native New Hampshire birches mingle with a bullet-riddled washer, abandoned bathroom fixtures, and several junk cars. Howard, anti-hero of this first novel in Ernest Hebert's highly acclaimed Darby series, is a mixture too. Howard's battle against encroaching change symbolizes the class conflict between indigenous Granite Staters scratching out a living and citified immigrants with 'college degrees and big bank accounts.' Like the winter-weakened deer threatened by the dogs of March -- the normally docile house pets whose instincts arouse them to chase and kill for sport -- Howard, too, is sorely beset.""","Hebert, Ernest",,Viking Press,1979,,English,,,,Book,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/4492057"">4492057</a>",,,,,,,,,,,,255,"New York, New York",,,9780670277469,,,http://www.upne.com/0-87451-719-2.html  http://www.dartmouth.edu/~ernesthebert/,,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/c6d95a33681a6e318f0cd3e74bf82667.jpg,Education;Family;Fiction and Literature;Keene NH;Labor History;Literary Works -- Fiction;Mills and Mill Work;Nashua NH;New Hampshire;Youth

Jones uses a rich and flexible neoformalist approach to argue his case for the importance of Kerouac’s rarely studied poem....After a brief summary of Kerouac’s poetic career, Jones embarks on a thorough reading of 'Mexico City Blues' from several different perspectives: he first focuses on Kerouac’s use of autobiography in the poem and then discusses how Kerouac’s various trips to Mexico, his conversion to Buddhism, his theory of spontaneous poetics, and his attraction to blues and jazz influenced the theme, structure, and sound of Mexico City Blues....Jones’s multidimensional explication suggests the formal and thematic complexity of Kerouac’s long poem and demonstrates the major contribution Mexico City Blues makes to post–World War II American poetry and poetics.""

347,Use My Name: Jack Kerouac's Forgotten Families,"From ECW Press: ""With this fascinating new book, Jim Jones debunks many of the myths surrounding the life and times of Jack Kerouac. Jones concentrates on those whose lives were most affected by Kerouac: daughter Jan Kerouac, wives Edie Parker, Joan Haverty, and Stella Sampas, as well as nephew Paul Blake Jr. 'Use My Name: Jack Kerouac's Forgotten Families' takes its title from advice given to Jan during her second and final meeting with Jack, who encouraged her to profit from the surname she shared with the famous author of 'On the Road.' Sadly, not one of these individuals so closely tied to Kerouac seems to have benefited from the connection, as Jones discovers in his in-depth interview with Jan. She discusses at length her 15 months as a prostitute, her own divorces, her hospitalization, and her life as an author, including a wild European book tour for [her novel] 'Baby Driver.' Although Kerouac is one of the most 'biographied' American writers of our time, Jones offers a new perspective on the King of the Beats and his generation, one in which formerly marginalized figures in the Kerouac storyâ€”particularly womenâ€”become strong, central characters. He also exposes the cut-throat wheeling and dealing that has plagued the Kerouac estate and that continues today as the various players do battle over the legacy of one of the counterculture's biggest idols.""","Jones, James T.",,ECW Press,1999,,English,,,,Book,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/40735081"">40735081</a>",,,,,,,,,,,,203,"Toronto, Ontario",,,9781550223750,,,http://www.ecwpress.com/books/use_my_name  Use My Name... @ Google Books (limited preview available here),,,,,,Alcohol and Drugs;Criticism and Review;Death and Disaster;Family;Fiction and Literature;Gender and Sexuality;Illness;Literary Works -- Criticism and History;New Mexico;New York NY;Personal History: Biography and Oral History

361,"La Souillonne, Deusse: Monologue sur scÃ¨ne","From the author's website: ""The dramatic monologue, La Souillonne, was such a tremendous success for its author, Norman Beaupré, that it prompted a friend of his to say, 'There must be a follow-up to this.' The author replied that he had not thought about it and that he did not think he had enough material in his creative imagination to write a sequel. However, after seeing the performance of the play twice at the Franco-American Heritage Center in Lewiston and seeing it again in Lamèque, New Brunswick this past summer performed to a sell-out crowd, he began to sift ideas in his mind especially once he heard sea stories by the performer, Marie Cormier's brother, Angelbert Paulin who had caught fish and crabs out in the open seas for some forty years. Beaupré now had at his disposition some materials about Acadians and the sea.

The story is told by a young precocious boy, Camille Roulin, son of the postal worker, Joseph Roulin. Van Gogh painted the portraits of the entire Roulin family while in Arles. The reader is brought into Van Gogh’s world of vibrant color and accomplished artistry by means of a close relationship with a boy who is privileged to follow the artist around in his many excursions throughout the countryside of Arles as well as other places frequented by the artist. The artist at work relates to the boy his techniques and theories on painting and drawing.

Autobiographical elements were, once again, noted by reviewers. By this time, however, Blaise seems to have become determined to forestall any easy connections between his own life and the materials of his fiction. He notes, following the acknowledgments, that 'Lunar Attractions' is fiction in the mode of autobiography, but that life was never lived.' The novel was reviewed favorably in Canada, although some commentators found the work melodramatic in places. Books in Canada gave 'Lunar Attractions' its annual award as the best first novel of the year.""

373,Little Canuck : The Adventures of an Immigrant Boy from QuÃ©bec,"Self-published memoir about life in QuÃ©bec, and life after QuÃ©bec. From iUniverse: ""Michel learns that his father is dying. This news precipitates a nostalgic journey into the past-a childhood spent on a dairy farm in French QuÃ©bec. As a sensitive boy secluded from the world, Michel wavers between forbidden exploits and heartbreaking tribulations. Catholic school is a culture shock, but it's the huge pumpkin-shaped teacher with a bad temper who terrorizes his brain most. On the farm, his young life abounds with fun and danger-mad bulls, dynamite sticks, runaway darts, lethal ice cubes, and hazardous farm equipment. After struggling with a dismal economy, his family is forced to abandon their home. They desert their isolated farmhouse and move into a cockroach-infested apartment in an English-speaking city one mile from the seductive United States border. There, Michel copes with bullies, Russian spies, and ghosts. 'Little Canuck' recounts the humorous, and at times, heartrending memoirs of a young boy on his journey through a colorful landscape of emotion. Along the way, young Michel uncovers the mysteries of female anatomy, and learns poignant truths about mortality. His most profound lessons are not learned at school.

Irish and Franco-American workers in the fictional Southeastern New England town of Millbank, Massachusetts, are desperate, but based on years of strife they distrust each other almost as much as they fear management. For decades, the owners have succeeded in keeping labor divided by ancestry. 'Au Revoir, L'Acadie' describes the heroic efforts of working men and women of great character to overcome their long-held prejudices to become workers and Americans instead of merely disgruntled ethnic victims. As working conditions deteriorate and profits disappear, a violent strike ensues and a worker is killed. Labor leaders, management, clergy, and town fathers must find their way back from the abyss of anarchy to save their followers and the town.""

390,Everything Matters!,"Waterville, Maine, native Ron Currie, Jr.’s sophomore effort, Everything Matters!, is not a story about aliens – although it could be. The voice in Junior Thibodeau’s head has told him precisely when the world will end. Lecturing robotically to him as he festers aware in the womb, the funny, supportive, but self-consciously standoffish clairvoyant(s) behind Junior’s genius goes on to narrate the second-person portion of his life story that Currie writes in all three tenses. Currie and his narrators - human and otherwise - give us entry into the lives of Junior's family and friends who live in a community that could very well be Currie's Waterville, Maine (though the author never says it outright). Many of the elements of Currie’s characters – stubborn, brusque, fraternal, reverent, prone to drink – share an often untold quality with the characters of many similar New England communities, their roots practically hidden here in plain view except for their attachment to French surnames. But even greater than this, Currie’s story reminds us of an America that has often done well to mask its strangers, to create a space where the insight provided by an alien voice in one’s head might be better lived out in secret, lived out well, than proffered unto disillusionment: a slight against Currie’s dictum that in spite of the world’s end, Everything Matters!","Currie, Ron, Jr.",,Viking Press,2009,,English,,,,Book,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/268957344"">268957344</a>",,,,,,,,,,,,305,"New York, New York",,,,,,http://www.roncurriejr.net/  Everything Matters! @ Google Books,,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/97baf4a6c3860422928d9e4303052723.jpg,Alcohol and Drugs;Death and Disaster;Fairfield ME;Family;Fiction and Literature;Kennebec River Valley;Literary Works -- Fiction;Sports and Leisure;Waterville ME
391,God Is Dead,"A collection of short stories loosely connected, all based on the premise of the death of God. From Viking Press: ""Ron Currie's gutsy, funny book is instantly gripping: If God takes human form and dies, what would become of life as we know it? Effortlessly combining outlandish humor with big questions about mortality, ethics, and human weakness, Ron Currie, Jr., holds a funhouse mirror to our present-day world. God has inhabited the mortal body of a young Dinka woman in the Sudan. When she is killed in the Darfur desert, he dies along with her, and word of his death soon begins to spread. Faced with the hard proof that there is no supreme being in charge, the world is irrevocably transformed, yet remains oddly recognizable.""

397,With Justice for All : A Three Act Play,"With Justice For All leads its reader through the drama surrounding the potential 1876 eviction of French families from their homes on disputed land in the St. John River Valley of Aroostook County, Maine.  A play in two languages, and a play that illustrates late-nineteenth-century Franco-American bilingualism, it moves from rural family life, to the Maine state legislature, and then to the courthouse in a unique display of the cultural range of the Maine citizenry of that era. By the dramaâ€™s end, playwright Guy Dubay has made a reassuring claim in defense of the stateâ€™s judicial system â€“ helping in this instance to protect the rights and traditions of early Franco-American landholders. From the text: ""The State of Maine, in 1868, had deeded a million acres of land, which included the St. John Valley, to the European and North American Railroad (E. & N.A. R.R.). The events in the decade to follow were to involve the Valley farmers in the stateâ€™s legislative process...Not until 1876, as the nation celebrated its centennial, did one hundred and forty-two families in Madawaska and Frenchville, Maine, receive eviction notices as a result of the impending bankruptcy of the European and North American Railroad. The French-American farmers, practically without formal education, for a time were at the mercy of lawyers and business people who accused Valley settlers with squatting. [SPOILER ALERT!] The drama ended in the Stateâ€™s Supreme Court where the dilemma of these citizensâ€™ rights to their property versus wholesale grants of state land to E. & N.A. R.R. was resolved.""","Dubay, Guy F.",,Title VII: Project BRAVE Bulletin,1976,,FranÃ§ais and English,,,,Book,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/2624099"">2624099</a>","1870s, Madawaska, Maine",,,,,,,,,,,73,"Madawaska, Maine",,,,,,None,,,,,,Acadians;Aroostook County ME;Family;Farming and Agriculture;Forestry;Government and Politics;Keegan ME;Language and Linguistics;Literary Works -- Drama;Madawaska ME;Social History;St. John River Valley;Van Buren ME

716,"The Run of the Mill : A Pictorial Narrative of the Expansion, Dominion, Decline, and Enduring Impact of the New England Textile Industry","A chronicle of centuries of labor in black and white photographs. Historical and modern perspectives on mills, industrial towns, and workers in New England from the earliest industrialization period to the 1970s. From the inside flap: ""The full force of American capitalism was first released through the creation, consolidation, and incredible profitability of the New England textile industry. It was along the energetic waterways of the Northeast that the Industrial Revolution cut its teeth, there that real manufacturing initially occurred, that goods, produced on native soil, were first distributed in substantial quantities. There, in short, that the modern corporation was conceived. This fascinating, generously illustrated and extensively documented study presents the full scope of that phenomenon by concentrating on its single most powerful and successful manifestation: the textile mill. This was America's first integrated history, so immense in its concentration that in 1832, of 106 manufacturing concerns in the United States with assets of over $100,000, a full 88 were listed as textile companies.... Dunwell's survey is divided into two sections. The first, replete with 250 photographs and sketches from a wide variety of sources, gives an historical overview, a concentrated history of the textile mill in New England from the early developments in native technology to the final abandonment of the region. The second examines the living remnants of the industry...Here he presents the people who are still working in the mills...""","Dunwell, Steve",,D.R.

740,"A Modern-Day Voyageur Family : Paddling the 3,000 Mile Fur Trade Canoe Route Across the U.S. and Canada","From the author: ""When Kevin and Ben Kent were ages seven and five, their parents conceived an exciting, enriching, and educational project for the family. As a team, they began paddling the 3,000 mile length of the mainline fur trade canoe route across the U.S. and Canada, retracing the steps of their French ancestors. This ancient native route, which consisted of an extensive series of rivers and lakes, stretched from Montreal to the Great Lakes to Ft. Chipewyan on Lake Athabasca, in northern Alberta. This was the primary highway on which most fur trade, military, and religious personnel had traveled and hauled cargo into and out of the interior regions of North America during the entire fur trade era. Successfully paddling this ancient water highway from end to end over a series of fifteen consecutive summer trips, the Kent family experienced daunting challenges and terrifying calamities, as well as innumerable thrills and a great deal of satisfaction. In the process, the members of the family also absorbed much geography and history, and, most importantly, developed an appreciation of their own inner strengths. This engrossing and thought-provoking account of the adventures of the family incorporates a considerable amount of fur trade history, in which their direct French ancestors participated from about 1618 to at least 1758. 'A Modern-Day Voyageur Family,' written by one of the pre-eminent historians of the fur trade era, serves as both a source of inspiration and a guidebook for other families, couples, and individuals who wish to paddle all or portions of the historic route, or various other wilderness waterways. It also provides vicarious experiences and myriad lessons for those individuals whose venturing usually takes place in a safe reading chair on land. This work consists of a vivid adventure story, a how-to guide, and a primer on virtually all aspects of the French fur trade, all in one volume.""","Kent, Timothy J.

742,"Destination Madawaska : Biographie de Charles Terrieau, pionnier acadien ","From the author: ""The book is a biography of Charles Theriault, first francophone settler in 1821-1823 of the lower Madawaska River in present-day St-Jacques. The book presents a brief history of the Acadian migration before the time of Charlesâ€™ trail-blazing in the wilderness of the Madawaska territory. The territory at that time was a â€˜no-manâ€™s landâ€™ that included much of northern Maine from Houlton and all of Madawaska county and parts of Victoria and Restigouche counties of northwestern New Brunswick. At that time, the territory was claimed by the United States as being part of the new state of Maine and was also claimed by England as being part of the new colony of New Brunswick. The dispute was settled by the Webster-Ashburton Treaty of 1842 which  chose the St-John River as the international boundary separating the United States and New Brunswick. The book presents the genealogy of the greater ThÃ©riault family in the St-John Valley showing that the population of all ThÃ©riaults until 1900 came from three branches of the Acadian family; one which migrated from the lower St-John to St-Basile around 1790 and two branches which had migrated from Acadia to Kamouraska, QC in 1759 and later migrated to the various Madawaska settlements between 1820 and 1860.""","TheÌriault, J.R.T.

From UNC Press: ""The violence and radicalism connected with the Industrial Workers of the World textile strike of 1912 in Lawrence, Massachusetts, left the popular impression that Lawrence was a slum-ridden city inhabited by un-American revolutionaries. 'Immigrant City' is a study of Lawrence which reveals that the city was far different....The population of Lawrence was almost completely immigrant in nature; in 1910, 90 per cent of its people were either first or second generation Americans, and they represented nearly every nation in the world. The period covered by the book--1845 through 1921--is the great middle period of American immigration, which began with the Irish Famine and ended with the Quota Law of 1921. While 'Immigrant City' concentrates on one American city, it reveals much about American immigration in general and demonstrates clearly that, in spite of the poverty that most immigrants fought, life for the foreign-born in America was not as grim as some writers have suggested.""","Cole, Donald ",Preview,UNC Press,2002 (1963),,en,,,,Book,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/475026"">475026</a>","1845-1921; Lawrence, Massachusetts",,,,,,,,,,,268,"Chapel Hill, North Carolina",,,9780807854082,,,http://uncpress.unc.edu/browse/book_detail?title_id=1094;Immigrant City... @ Google Books,,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/f92652bfb714d037b78a2ba4ebe90be9.jpg,Acculturation and Assimilation;Community: Customs and Social Life;Death and Disaster;Emigration and Immigration;Family;Government and Politics;Haverhill MA;Irish Americans;Italian Americans;Labor History;Lawrence MA;Massachusetts;Merrimack River Valley;Mills and Mill Work;Nonfiction;Nonfiction -- History -- Labor and Social;Nonfiction -- Immigration;QuÃ©bec;Religion;Social History;Spicket River

765,The Belles of New England : The Women of the Textile Mills and the Families Whose Wealth They Wove,"A history of New England women during industrialization, and the lifestyle differences among women of different economic classes.  From Thomas Dunne Books: ""This is a masterful, definitive, and eloquent look at the enormous cultural and economic impact on America of New England's textile mills. The author, an award-winning CBS producer, traces the history of American textile manufacturing back to the ingenuity of Francis Cabot Lodge. The early mills were an experiment in benevolent enlightened social responsibility on the part of the wealthy owners, who belonged to many of Boston's finest families. But the fledgling industry's ever-increasing profits were inextricably bound to the issues of slavery, immigration, and workers' rights....William Moran brings a newsman's eye for the telling detail to this fascinating saga that is equally compelling when dealing with rags and when dealing with riches. In part a microcosm of America's social development during the period, 'The Belles of New England' casts a new and finer light on this rich tapestry of vast wealth, greed, discrimination, and courage.""","Moran, William",Preview,Thomas Dunne Books / St. Martin's Press,2002,,en,,,,Book,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/49627749"">49627749</a>",19th century - early 20th century; New England,,,,,,,,,,,292,"New York, New York",,,9780312301835,,,http://us.macmillan.com/thebellesofnewengland;The Belles of New England... @ Google Books,,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/961c99006f06063aacf5c94ce14e04f0.jpg,Acculturation and Assimilation;Biddeford ME;Boston MA;Business and Economics;Connecticut;Death and Disaster;Emigration and Immigration;England;Ethnicity and Collective Identity;Farming and Agriculture;Gender and Sexuality;Great Britain;Ireland;Labor History;Lawrence MA;Lewiston ME;Lowell MA;Manchester NH;Mills and Mill Work;Nashua NH;New Bedford MA;New England;Nonfiction;Nonfiction -- History -- Economic and Industrial;Nonfiction -- History -- Labor and Social;Personal History: Biography and Oral History;QuÃ©bec;Religion;Saco ME;Saco River Valley;Social History;Sports and Leisure;Waltham MA

The rise and fall of Amoskeag, in photos. A volume in the broad-ranging ""Images of America"" series of books. Previously published under the title ""A World Within a World."" From Arcadia Publishing: ""This fascinating and moving book brings to life the industrial and immigrant experience which gave birth to Manchester in the nineteenth century and continued to shape the city's destiny well into the twentieth century. More than a hundred years ago, thousands of immigrants from Europe and Canada were drawn to the mills of Manchester by the promise of a better life. In stirring photographs and text, 'Manchester: The Mill and the Immigrant Experience' examines the aspirations, the struggles, and the everyday adventures of Manchester's immigrant families. Reaffirming the power of photography to move and inform us, 'Manchester: The Mills and the Immigrant Experience' creates a vivid picture of life during nearly a century of rapid industrial change. We join the bustle of Elm and Hanover Streets in the 1880s, witness children working at the mighty Amoskeag Manufacturing Company, enter a Greek coffeehouse in the early 1900s, get caught up in the bitter labor strikes of the 1920s, and meet unusual local figures such as the Hermit of Mosquito Pond.""","Samson, Gary",,Arcadia Publishing,2000,,en,,,,Book,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/46874965"">46874965</a>","1860-1935; Manchester, New Hampshire",,,,,,,,,,,128,"Charleston, South Carolina",,,9780738504773,,,Manchester : The Mills and the Immigrant Experience @ Arcadia Publishing  Manchester : The Mills and the Immigrant Experience @ Google Books,,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/48262a471ae1e50b83700b05b9e9cb60.jpg,Art and Architecture;Business and Economics;Community: Customs and Social Life;Emigration and Immigration;Ethnicity and Collective Identity;German Americans;Greek Americans;Irish Americans;Labor History;Lithuanian Americans;Manchester NH;Merrimack River Valley;Mills and Mill Work;Nonfiction;Nonfiction -- History -- Local;Nonfiction -- History -- Pictorial;Polish Americans;Scottish Americans;Swedish Americans

The importance of recognizing such patterns and morals for health and social service providers.

Originally presented as, ""The French-Canadians of Vermont: Cultural Implications for Health and Social Services Providers,"" at a meeting sponsored by the University of Vermont Department of Psychology, November, 1981. From Woolfson: ""Though a number of Franco-Vermonters do not display visible trappings of their French-Canadian heritage, many still share, as do other ethnic groups, inherited cultural patterns and values. This paper examines some of these patterns and values with an eye to describing their importance for health and social services providers in particular.

907,The Cities on the Saco : A Pictorial History,"A photo-history of the cities of the Saco River Valley in southern Maine. A heavily researched and crafted exhibition of landscapes from colonization to contemporary times, 'The Cities on the Saco' weaves a storytelling tapestry of Saco, Biddeford, and the Old Orchard regions that should be held dearly by their diverse coastal communities. From the text: ""Here are the many scenes which our ancestors saw but, equally important, the images (economic, social, political) which Saco, Biddeford, and Old Orchard became.

908,Of Place and Gender: Women in Maine History,"From UMaine Press: ""This volume of fourteen essays on Maine women's history fills a real need, helping to answer questions about what women were doing in local communities and highlighting their similarities and differences from women elsewhere. Maine women were sometimes in the forefront of change and sometimes lagged behind; most of the time they were preoccupied with the tasks of daily life, as were women in other parts of the world. However, the details of women's activities at home and in the community, like the context in which they were done, helps to set Maine women apart. The essays in this volume offer insight into a rich variety of Maine women, some famous and some ordinary, some intent on changing their lives and their society and others struggling to survive, some confined by family and work to farm or village and others able to travel the world. Taken together, their stories enrich our understanding of Maine, of women, and of history.""","Weiner, Marli Frances (editor)",,University of Maine Press,2005,,en,,,,Book,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/61184330"">61184330</a>",Maine,,,,,,,,,,,484,"Orono, Maine",University of Maine Press,,9780891011057,,,Of Place and Gender... @ UMaine Press;Of Place and Gender... @ Google Books,,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/89d2911bdedd0f6eed2c146cb1cf5837.jpg,Appleton ME;Bangor ME;Community: Customs and Social Life;Emigration and Immigration;Essay;Ethnicity and Collective Identity;Farming and Agriculture;Fryeburg ME;Gender and Sexuality;Indian Island ME;Labor History;Lewiston ME;Maine;Mills and Mill Work;Nonfiction;Nonfiction -- History -- Labor and Social;Old Town ME;Orono ME;Personal History: Biography and Oral History;Portland ME;Searsport ME;Skowhegan ME;Sports and Leisure
909,Frenchmen into Peasants: Modernity and Tradition in the Peopling of French Canada,"History text on the later migrations of the French to Atlantic Canada, written by the Director of the French Institute at Assumption College in Worcester, Massachusetts. From Harvard University Press: ""In unprecedented detail, Leslie Choquette narrates the peopling of French Canada across the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the lesser known colonial phase of French migration. Drawing on French and Canadian archives, she carefully traces the precise origins of individual immigrants, describing them by gender, class, occupation, region, religion, age, and date of departure. Her archival work is impressive: of the more than 30,000 emigrants who embarked for Quebec and the Maritimes during the French Regime, nearly 16,000 are chronicled here....In considering the pattern of emigration in the context of migration history, Choquette shows that, in many ways, the movement toward Canada occurred as a by-product of other, perennial movements, such as the rural exodus or interurban labor migrations. Overall, emigrants to Canada belonged to an outwardly turned and mobile sector of French society, and their migration took place during a phase of vigorous Atlantic expansion. They crossed the ocean to establish a subsistence economy and peasant society, traces of which lingered on into the twentieth century. Because Choquette looks at the entire history of French migration to Canada--its social and economic aspects as well as its place in the larger history of migration--her work makes a remarkable contribution in the field of immigration history.""

Abstract from the text: ""Bilingual programs should focus on promoting psychosocial growth rather than language growth. Risk taking, change, and creativity should characterize the approach to bilingual education. Traditional ideas about language learning may not be suitable. It is not necessarily true that children cannot learn a second language unless it is taught to them. The behavioristic, audiolingual approach may not be the best for the bilingual child. Bilingual educators should not be overly concerned about the orthodoxy of their methods. The corrective approach to language teaching may not be the most appropriate one for the young bilingual child.  Promoting psychosocial growth involves educating teachers and generating community involvement. The students must be given the basic tools to manage their own growth in two languages at an early age.""","Dugas, Donald G.",Read: FULL TEXT,,1971,,English,,,,Book,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/425621535"">425621535</a>",1970s; United States,,,,,,,,,,,17,,,,,,,http://www.eric.ed.gov/PDFS/ED055482.pdf,,,,,,Community: Customs and Social Life;Education;Language and Linguistics

From the book jacket: ""This is the story of a French-Canadian lad who was brought up in poverty and never wanted to abandon his parents and whose conduct and accomplishments have been exemplary.""...""In 1909 Felix Albert, at the age of 64, stood on street corners in Lowell, Massachusetts, hawking for 50 cents what he probably hoped would be a minor bestseller, his own life story, 'Histoire d'un enfant pauvre'....Felix's autobiography was almost lost to our generation. Fortunately, and rather fortuitously, local historian Richard Santerre discovered 'Un enfant pauvre' a few years ago in a Lowell attic, and that copy is at present on deposit at the Boston Public Library. Only one other copy is known to exist and it is in private hands."" <br />","Albert, FeÌlix",,,1909 (1991),"Eno, Arthur L., Jr. (translator);LabbeÌ, Yvon A.

The authors draw on a wide variety of approaches and data sources to examine marriage, fertility, family and household composition, and life style in rapidly changing nineteenth-century America....The essays in 'Family and Population in Nineteenth Century America' clearly demonstrate the shortcomings of other studies which draw conclusions about family and household patterns from the study of the social facts contained in aggregate data.

977,Manuel du Professeur pour introduire les Ã©tudes Franco-AmÃ©ricaines,"Freeman and Pelletierâ€™s self-proclaimed ""manuel"" (handbook) seeks to validate Franco-American Studies as a legitimate academic discipline, and to insert this discipline into the broader field of American Cultural Studies. In 284 pages, the authors suggest lesson plans for the construction of relevant curricula, particular topics of study on Franco-America, and a rationale for the inclusion of a body of Franco-American knowledge in the fabric of a social studies education for youth and adults alike. Acknowledging the plain lack of academic materials, Freeman and Pelletier not only offer an outline for students to create their own genealogies, but also encourage students to engage their Franco communities, to utilize old and build new living resources for multiculturalism in theory and practice. The handbook concludes with a bibliography of texts and an index of local people and places that might function as resources for Franco-American studies both in- and outside of the classroom. From the text:  ""This handbook was produced by the Canadian/Franco-American Studies Project of the University of Maine at Orono for the use of teachers in elementary and secondary schools and in adult education.  Its purpose is to achieve more widespread awareness and understanding of the Franco-American presence in New England by offering teaching plans and strategies for incorporating materials designed for that purpose into the regular courses of study within the humanities curriculumâ€¦.We feel that the contributions of Franco-Americans to the development of their communities, their states, and their country has been one of the nationâ€™s best-kept secrets.  We also feel that exploring these areas can be a source of pride for members of the Franco-American communities and lead students of other backgrounds to a better understanding of our multi-ethnic society.""","Freeman, Stanley L.;Pelletier, Raymond",,,1981,,FranÃ§ais and English,,,,Book,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/7632708"">7632708</a>","20th century, North America",,,,,,,,,,,284,"Orono, Maine","Canadian/Franco-American Studies Project, University of Maine",,,,,http://www.eric.ed.gov/PDFS/ED280755.pdf (full text available here)   http://books.google.com/books?id=WA1XHQAACAAJ&dq=manuel+du+professeur+freeman&hl=en&ei=IdMfTNSTLIOB8gbT1M3uBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA,,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/7c3b6e96079ec2b485a747645e6a22f9.jpg,Bibliography;Education;Ethnicity and Collective Identity;Genealogy;Nonfiction;Nonfiction -- Education

979,Franco-Americans in Vermont : A Civil Rights Perspective,"From the members of the Vermont Advisory Committee: ""The report presents an historic overview of the French-Canadian presence in Vermont over the past 300 years, a discussion of the size of the State's Franco-American population, and the different definitions and techniques used in identifying Franco-Americans. In the chapter on Status, data are presented which demonstrate statistical disparities between Franco-Americans and the Anglo population in education and employment. Societal attitudes reflected in scholarly works and in fiction are surveyed as well.  Franco-Americans have been the victims of anti-Catholic, anti-foreign sentiment in the past, and of negative stereotyping in much of the 20th century.  To determine whether these attitudes result in actions (discrimination), which in turn result in the observed disparities, is a formidable process, requiring additional historical research and analyses of educational and employment practices. Through this report, the advisory committee hopes to identify directions for future study.""",Vermont Advisory Committee to the United States Commission on Civil Rights,,,1983,"Bright, Louvenia D.

988,The Cows Are Out!: Two Decades on a Maine Dairy Farm,"From Islandport Press: ""Family dairy farms are disappearing in Maine and with them, a way of life. Trudy Chambers Price has captured the daily joys and struggles of the family farm in a way that ensures this Maine way of life will not be forgotten....Price and her husband raised two sons and hundreds of cows on Craneland Farm in Central Maine. The work was never-ending and exhausting, but also exhilarating and rewarding. In this bittersweet memoir of two decades of dairy farming, Chambers writes of the daily trials of haying, cow breeding and milking against a backdrop of gentle and entertaining rural life. She introduces kind neighbors, eccentric neighbors, visiting city folk and loveable pets. 'The Cows Are Out!' is a tribute to hard-working family farmers and to an important part of Maine's historical and cultural heritage.""","Price, Trudy Chambers",,Islandport Press,2004,,English,,,,Book,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/55659235"">55659235</a>","20th century, Central Maine",,,,,,,,,,,220,"Yarmouth, Maine",Islandport Press,,0967166292,,,http://www.islandportpress.com/cows.html   http://books.google.com/books?id=YpOqAAAACAAJ&dq=price%3B+the+cows+are+out&hl=en&ei=IvtrTICsH4K78gbKnrmmCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA,,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/072295c91f40fca99233e30eec649925.jpg,Aroostook County ME;Caribou ME;Community: Customs and Social Life;Family;Farming and Agriculture;Gender and Sexuality;Houlton ME;Maine;Personal History: Biography and Oral History;Thorndike ME

991,Storytelling in Daily Life : Performing Narrative,"Performance studies theory text. Maine Franco American case studies in a discussion of the methods and forms of storytelling. Written by two University of Maine professors. From Temple University Press: ""The authors ably guide readers through the complex world of performing narrative. Along the way they show the embodied contexts of storytelling, the material constraints on narrative performances, and the myriad ways storytelling orders information and tasks, constitutes meanings, and positions speaking subjects. Readers will also learn that narrative performance is consequential as well as pervasive, as storytelling opens up experience and identities to legitimization and critique. The authors' multi-leveled model of strategy and tactics considers how relations of power in a system are produced, reproduced, and altered in performing narrative....The authors explain this strategic model through an extended discussion of family storytelling, using Franco Americans in Maine as their exemplar. They explore what stories families tell, how they tell them, and how storytelling creates family identities. Then, they show the range and reach of this strategic model by examining storytelling in diverse contexts: a breast cancer narrative, a weblog on the Internet, and an autobiographical performance on the public stage. Readers are left with a clear understanding of how and why the performance of narrative is the primary communicative practice shaping our lives today.""","Langellier, Kristin;Peterson, Eric E.",Preview,,2004,,en,,,,Book,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/52214849"">52214849</a>",20th century - 21st century; Maine,,,,,,,,,,,280,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",Temple University Press,,9781592132133,,,http://www.temple.edu/tempress/titles/1717_reg.html http://books.google.com/books?id=cjFZLXskuiMC&pg=PP1&dq=storytelling+in+daily+life:+performing+narrative&cd=1#v=onepage&q&f=false (limited preview available here),,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/69ee2adb56013b6fa8096130fa8a1bee.jpg,Acculturation and Assimilation;Bangor ME;Criticism and Review;Ethnicity and Collective Identity;Family;Gender and Sexuality;Language and Linguistics;Lewiston ME;Maine;Nonfiction;Nonfiction -- Performance Studies;Old Town ME;Performing Arts;Personal History: Biography and Oral History;St. John River Valley

While the young people may have lost or may never have acquired French as a household language, many still understand it; and growing numbers, acknowledging it as a cultural tool, want it back.

Prejudice and Pride examines and compares how English and French Canadian intellectuals viewed American society from 1891 to 1945. Based on over five hundred texts drawn largely from the era's periodical literature, the study reveals that English and French Canadian intellectuals shared common preoccupations with the United States, though the English tended to emphasize political issues and the French cultural issues.... Significantly, the era's discourse regarding American life and the Canadian-American relationship was less an expression of nationalism or a reaction to US policy than it was about the expression of wider attitudes concerning modernity.""","BeÌlanger, Damien-Claude",Preview,University of Toronto Press,2011,,en,,,,Book,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/466659872"">466659872</a>",1891-1945; Canada; United States,,,,,,,,,,,320,"Toronto, Ontario",,,9781442640450,,,http://www.utppublishing.com/Prejudice-and-Pride-Canadian-Intellectuals-Confront-the-United-States-1891-1945.html ;Prejudice and Pride... @ Google Books,,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/e9cedba082a174d96efccbbe3f89bb3c.jpg,Acculturation and Assimilation;Business and Economics;Canada;Emigration and Immigration;Ethnicity and Collective Identity;Gender and Sexuality;Government and Politics;Labor History;Nonfiction -- History -- Intellectual;Social History;United States

1272,Un Jacques Cartier errant : trois pieÌ€ces ,"GrÃ©goire Chabotâ€™s triple collection sits English and French texts face-to-face in a small variety of dramatics and family humor, where characters carry in tow a heavy load of self-pity, but where comedic endings refuse to resign any one of Chabotâ€™s dopes to the hellish literary annals of inevitable suffering. The title play of the collection brings sixteenth-century French explorer Jacques Cartier to a nearly empty Franco-American pour-house in a modern mill town, only for the distinguished and costumed guest to find himself in New England â€“ not New France. Chabotâ€™s second, 'Chere Maman,' shows us a family of bickering, adult-age children uniting around the 10th anniversary of Mamanâ€™s death and the 21st birthday of their lone niece, watching family change by the not so dissimilar courses of death and growth. 'Sans Atout,' the third and final piece, places a television at the center of an elderly Franco American coupleâ€™s Thanksgiving Eve and Day, channeling onto stage not only the burdens that alcohol consumption can place on relationships (or vice versa), but the disconcerting effects of modernity on a family steeped in holiday tradition. All three plays toy heartwarmingly with a barrage of linguistic idiosyncrasies, the sentiments of which are familiar to the many literatures that concern family life in post-immigrant Americana. With a gift for wordplay, Chabot is able to exaggerate smartly the New England French stereotypes about sports, drinking, family, work, and religion to the point that exceeds ridiculousness and becomes â€“ for better or for worse â€“ entirely familiar.","Chabot, GreÌgoire",,University of Maine Press,1996,,FranÃ§ais and English,,,,Book,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/34983292"">34983292</a>",,,,,,,,,,,,291,"Orono, Maine",,,9781595266934,,,Un Jacques Cartier errant...@ Google Books,,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/fdf9e70a8dcfe7fe7a0bf4cf27b3fb62.jpg,Acculturation and Assimilation;Alcohol and Drugs;Community: Customs and Social Life;Death and Disaster;Ethnicity and Collective Identity;Family;Fiction and Literature;Illness;Labor History;Language and Linguistics;Literary Works -- Drama;Mills and Mill Work;New England;Performing Arts;Religion;Sports and Leisure

1281,French Connections : A Gathering of Franco-American Poets,"A collection of poetry and essays written by and for Franco America. Varying artistic and literary expressions from writers who share - at least to some degree - in a similar cultural reality. From the editor's website: ""This anthology began with an innuendo: the unnamed advisor to President George W. Bush who was quoted in the New York Times in 2004 as saying of Massachusetts’ senator John Kerry . . . that Kerry 'looks French.' This was not intended as a compliment....What does it mean to look – or to sound – French...or more specifically, Franco-American? Even just thinking casually about this question highlighted the issue. For the majority of Americans, if the term itself brought any image to mind, it was likely a red-and-white can of bland spaghetti...Why is Franco-American so occult an identity in America?The vision for this anthology was not that it would define Franco-American in any essentialist way and it was not even to collect a group of poems on the theme of French identity. Instead what I had in mind was to bring some measure of visibility to Franco-American through a simple gathering of poets you might well never have thought of holding this particular component of identity in common and letting the poets speak for themselves: in their short bio-essays and in their poems, to provide a forum from which one could hear the wide spectrum of what it might mean to “sound French.” And that is definitely intended as a compliment, though you may find it means things you didn’t expect.""","Gelineau, Christine (editor);Bedell, Jack (editor)",,Louisiana Literature Press,2007,,English,,,,Book,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/183201916"">183201916</a>",,,,,,,,,,,,324,"Hammond, Louisiana",,,9780945083016,,,http://www.christinegelineau.com/Books/French.htm  French Connections...@ Google Books,,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/ce20b6a1bbff74fb85d0d28d647c3866.jpg,Essay;Ethnicity and Collective Identity;Literary Works -- Anthology;Poetry;United States

1286,"Vows : The Story of a Priest, a Nun, and Their Son","The biography of a Catholic nun and a Catholic priest in Boston, Massachusetts - their work and their faith, their marriage and their family - written by their son. Moves through the author's youth and his own unique relationship with faith and doctrine. An intimate and intimately-told story of religion in America, especially Catholicism, during and after the social upheavel of the middle twentieth century. From Free Press: ""'Vows' is a compelling story of one family's unshakable faith that to be called is to serve, however high the cost may be. Peter Manseau's riveting evocation of his parents' parallel childhoods, their similar callings, their experiences in the seminary and convent, and how they met while tending to the homeless of Roxbury, Massachusetts, during the riot-prone 1960s is a page-turning meditation on the effect that love can have on profound faith.""","Manseau, Peter",,"Free Press, Simon and Schuster",2005,,English,,,,Book,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/60373489"">60373489</a>",,,,,,,,,,,,383,"New York, New York",,,9780743249072,,,http://www.petermanseau.com/books.html#vows  Vows... @ Google Books (limited preview available),,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/d037dd4d29525981089519bfc8b87847.jpg,Amherst MA;Boston MA;Dorchester MA;Family;Framingham MA;Gender and Sexuality;Lowell MA;Medford MA;Personal History: Biography and Oral History;Religion;Roxbury MA;Social History;Somerville MA;United States
1287,First-Person America,"Edited and annotated compilation of oral histories from the Federal Writers' Project of the 1930s Works Progress/Projects Administration (WPA) in the United States. These selections come mostly in the form of short passages that aspiring writers recorded from people in various parts of the United States during the onslaught and aftermath of the Great Depression. Banks's famous book is an indispensable part of the canon of American social history, and a testament to the efforts of recorders of local American histories in the 1930s. From the author's website: ""First Person America brings together eighty oral histories gathered in the 1930's by the Federal Writers Project, including stories of a North Carolina patent medicine pitchman, a retired Oregon gold prospector, a Bahamian midwife from Florida, a Key West smuggler, Chicago jazz musicians, union organizers and others.""","Banks, Ann",,A.A.

A biographical study of a quÃ©bÃ©coise and first-generation Franco American author and her works - as a means, Shideler writes, ""to identify the position of the immigrant at the juncture of two diverse societies and ways of life"" (2).

1294,Death and Rebirth of the American Mill Town,"Essay on the divisions of power and labor in industrialized American economies - more specifically, mill towns - as transformations of earlier forms of authority in America. Uses the thought-work of Marx, Durkheim, and Weber, as well as the social critics and historians who have applied these thinkers' theories to the historical present. From the author: ""The problem of power in nineteenth century mill towns rests on a conflict between employer absolutism and the democratic rights of the employees. The treatment of power in recent community studies has been inadequate. This is particularly true in works influenced by symbolic anthropology, where the problem is seen to have been resolved in a consensual value system. However, the persistence of conflict in strikes and disorder compels an examination of the mechanisms of domination, as well as legitimacy. To this end, the ideas of Marx and Weber offer more valuable guidance than those of Durkheim.""","Dawley, Alan",,,1981 Autumn - 1982 Spring,,en,,,,Journal Article,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/181819835"">181819835</a>",19th and 20th centuries; United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0700-3862,,,Labour/Le Travail,http://www.jstor.org/stable/25140075,8/9,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/cdbc8b8547541d172e1da44e6381f7de.jpg,Business and Economics;Community: Customs and Social Life;Labor History;Mills and Mill Work;Nonfiction;Nonfiction -- Government and Politics;Nonfiction -- History -- Economic and Industrial;Nonfiction -- History -- Labor and Social;United States

Essay that situates the early-twentieth-century ""mystic stigmatic"" figure of Marie-Rose Ferron in a Franco American religious history. Using Ferron's biography as measure, Kaell sees the fringe cult around her, as well as her failed canonization, in contrast with the popular saintly tradition of the Canadian ThÃ©rÃ¨se of Lisieux. Kaell teases out this and other comparisons between Franco and QuÃ©bÃ©cois religiosity and nationalism using Ferron's life and history. From the author: ""First, this paper is an examination of how a hagiographer, OnÃ©sime Boyer, worked to create a saint cult that ultimately ended in failure. Second, and more importantly, this paper uses Boyerâ€™s construction of Roseâ€™s cult to provide a window into Franco-American Catholic culture that was incorporating wider trends, like 'victimhood,' and anchoring itself firmly in an American milieu. Finally, this paper raises a number of questions for further study, urging more comprehensive analyses of Franco-American history and religion.""","Kaell, Hillary",Full text,,2007,,en,,,,Journal Article,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/12864095"">12864095</a>","1930-1955; Woonsocket, Rhode Island",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0827-1704,,,Historical Studies,http://umanitoba.ca/colleges/st_pauls/ccha/Historical%20Studies%20vol%2073%20Final%20(2).pdf (full text available here) ;http://umanitoba.ca/colleges/st_pauls/ccha/,73,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/ae1b91ae610dca467f66ce52c01f01ab.jpg,Acculturation and Assimilation;Criticism and Review;Emigration and Immigration;Ethnicity and Collective Identity;Fall River MA;Gender and Sexuality;New England;Nonfiction;Nonfiction -- History -- Religion;Ogdensburg NY;Personal History: Biography and Oral History;QuÃ©bec;Religion;Social History;War;Woonsocket RI

A brief chronological survey. Includes remarks on turbulent relations between some American Church leaders favoring immigrant assimilation and some French Canadian immigrants resisting the Anglicization of their institutions. Gauges the accuracy of the truism among Franco Americans that there exists a connection between preserving the French language and maintaining one's Catholic faith. Acknowledges the transformations that take place in Franco American communities alongside specific legislative, academic, or ecclesiastical attitudes toward language use. Follows, through measures of Church activity, the phenomena of tightly knit Franco American communities beginning to disperse and dissolve in the twentieth century. As the title adds, also contains thoughts on the future of Franco American culture in New England as related to the decline of the French language, the decline in the number of Catholic priests, and the modern notion of American ""individuality"" that the author positions at the base of ethnic community dissolution.","Potvin, Raymond H.",,,2003-06 (summer),,en,,,,Journal Article,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/47828739"">47828739</a>",1800-2003; New England,,,,,,English,,,,,,,,,,2,American Catholic Studies,http://www.publications.villanova.edu/acs/index.html,114,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/00fdf973e5ecc3574135c58527f41b7a.jpg,Acculturation and Assimilation;Burlington VT;Community: Customs and Social Life;Connecticut River Valley;Education;Emigration and Immigration;Government and Politics;Language and Linguistics;Maine;Massachusetts;New England;New Hampshire;Nonfiction;Nonfiction -- History -- Religion;Providence RI;QuÃ©bec;Religion;Rhode Island;Springfield MA;Vermont;Worcester MA

1324,The Role of Fr. Jean-Baptiste Proulx in the Danielson Affair and in the Manitoba School Question,"From the author: ""The thesis is an examination of the role of Fr. Jean-Baptiste Proulx as an intermediary for the French-Canadian laity at St. Jamesâ€™ Church in Danielson, Connecticut in the parish discord known as the Danielson Affair, and as a secret ambassador of Prime Minister Wilfred Laurier for negotiations with Pope Leo XIII in order to settle the Manitoba School Question in 1896. The thesis re-examines the histories that have been written about Fr. Proulxâ€™s role in both historical events, and the histories that are examined are the book and dissertation by Sr. Dolores Liptak, European Immigrants and the Catholic Church in Connecticut, 1870-1920, and Robert Rumillyâ€™s Histoire des Franco-AmeÌricains and volumes eight and nine of his series, Histoire de la Province du QueÌbec. ... The sources that are used to re-examine the histories are sources that Robert Rumilly used, such as the Papers of Fr. Proulx that are held by the National Archives of Quebec at Montreal, as well as Fr. Proulxâ€™s own account as an intermediary in the Danielson Affair, entitled: â€œJournal of My Steps and Walks in the Diocese of Hartford on the Subject of Danielson by the Reverend J.B. Proulx, Parish Priest of St. Lin.â€ Also used are several contemporary newspapers in Connecticut, as well as three French-language newspapers that were published in Montreal and in Southern New England. In the analysis of the Danielson Affair and the Manitoba School Question, the thesis examines the development of several documents in light of either historical event. ... Also, the thesis analyzes two speeches from the Eleventh Convention of the Canadiens-AmeÌricains du Connecticut that was held in September 1896, and how they became two documents about the Danielson Affair that were forwarded to Fr. Proulx while he was in Rome. Other documents that are examined are the decision of the Connecticut Supreme Court of Errors on the contested election of lay trustees at St. Jamesâ€™ Church in Danielson, known as 'State ex rel. George Barry vs. Eli Getty and James Reynolds,' and the response by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Hartford to the said decision that changed the state laws for the incorporation of Catholic parishes, 'An Act concerning the Organization of Roman Catholic Churches' in 1903.""","Marceau, Albert J.

1329,Becoming Holy in Early Canada : Performance and the Making of Holy Persons in Society and Culture,"From the author: ""In this dissertation, I analyze how local religious figures became holy and the social functions they played, in order to better understand the connections between religion and colonialism and the shaping of faith communities over time. The study covers a broad time period from the early days of French settlement in Canada to the late nineteenth century. The focus falls on New France and the holy persons associated with the early years of settlement when religion and colonization were intimately connected. It was only towards the end of the nineteenth century that these figures were put forward for official recognition by the church in canonization causes, and consequently I conclude the study with an examination of the processes and resulting documents that contributed to the transformation of local holy persons into saints. Throughout the study, I concentrate on the place holy persons occupied in local society both during life and after death as intercessors for the faithful, the meanings they held and presented to their audiences, and the ways they performed the traditions of sanctity. Rituals of holiness were a form of communication. Holy persons and audiences interacted with and influenced one another to create a saint that was efficacious and effective. While faith communities developed around local, family and community networks, hagiographic texts described the lives, deaths and intercessions of select individuals and spread cults of belief. Between performances of holiness and the inscription of holy lives into texts, local saints were made who responded to the needs of their faith communities and became important parts of local religious, social, and cultural life.""","Pearson, Timothy G.

On the one hand, the notion of a collective Francophone identity has been evolving for several decades. On the other, changing demographics are challenging the already elusive concept of Francophone identity across Canada, thus making the notion increasingly difficult to define. The question therefore remains: who is Francophone in Canada?...As a Francophone teacher-researcher in a minority setting, I am particularly drawn to explore how Grade 7 students perceive and construct the francophonie and their Francophone identity as lived in Alberta. Specifically, I consider how stories of history, memory, language and geography explore the lived experience of Francophones in Alberta, especially during an era of increasing pluralism...""","Thompson, Laura Anne ",Full text,,2008,,en; fr,,,,Thesis/Dissertation,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/229425429"">229425429</a>",21st century; Alberta,,,,,,English and franÃ§ais,,,,,391,"Edmonton, Alberta",,,,,,A Geography of the Imaginary... @ Google Books;A Geography of the Imaginary... @ Library and Archives Canada,,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/cd514f4cf02e351db300618d91d8b4d5.jpg,Acculturation and Assimilation;Alberta;Canada;Community: Customs and Social Life;Education;Ethnicity and Collective Identity;Geography;Government and Politics;Language and Linguistics;Nonfiction;Nonfiction -- Education;Nonfiction -- French in North America;Religion

It demonstrates what pushed and pulled [Canadian and American] snowbirds to Florida, analyzes their journey south, their settlement patterns and housing choices, their tendency to congregate together, the forms of their sociability. It mostly defines snowbirds as migrants who, down South, build communities of kindred spirits. In the fragmented built landscape of 20th-century Florida, the congregation of snowbirds produced unique forms of socialization and, we argue, of community.

They were subsequently joined by other migrants from French Canada. The settlers lived off subsistence farming till 1824, when lumbercamps opened in the region. They were isolated as no road connected the Upper St. John Valley with other settled region until the 1830s. The only means of communication between Madawaska and the outside world was through the St. John and Madawaska Rivers and through portages to the St. Lawrence. This study examines the interaction between family, kinship networks and the process of community formation over the first sixty years of this settlement. It is based primarily on quantitative sources: parish registers, censuses, land records, but also uses existing traditional evidence. Consequently, it extensively uses quantitative and demographic techniques.""","Craig, BeÌatrice (Chevalier)",,,1983,,en,,,,Thesis,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/52377703"">52377703</a>","1785-1842; Madawaska, Maine; New Brunswick",,,,,,,,,,,227,"Orono, Maine",,,,,,"Family, Kinship and Community... @ Fogler Library, UMaine",,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/377b91e88b982dd69b15e1af9732525c.jpg,Acadians;Aroostook County ME;Community: Customs and Social Life;Demography;Emigration and Immigration;Ethnicity and Collective Identity;Family;Farming and Agriculture;Geography;Labor History;Language and Linguistics;Madawaska ME;Native Americans;New Brunswick;Nonfiction;Nonfiction -- French in North America;Nonfiction -- History -- Labor and Social;Religion;Social History;St. John River Valley

1365,"Cotton Was King : A History of Lowell, Massachusetts","A collection of 14 essays on the history of Chelmsford and Lowell, Massachusetts, from pre-incorporation to industrialization, into the middle 20th century. As the title suggests, an emphasis on the prevalence of mill work and immigrants cultures very much responsible for shaping life in this, one of New England's most productive industrialized cities. From the editor: ""'Cotton Was King' traces Lowell's history from its Indian beginnings through two centuries of the history of the town of Chelmsford and one hundred and fifty years of urban industrial history, to the present day. The history of Lowell is, in microcosm, the history of America's Industrial Revolution. The city's history is a case study in the evolution of the corporate system, the labor movement, and the role women played in the labor force. The cotton mills of Lowell provided the first opportunity for American women to leave their farms and families and earn an independent living. The city with its enormous factories and canals also served as a magnet for the first waves of immigrants. By the mid-nineteenth century the city felt the first stirrings of both the labor and feminist movements, as Lowell entrepreneurs expanded the factory system.""","Eno, Arthur L.

1380,Family Time and Industrial Time : The Relationship Between the Family and Work in a New England Industrial Community,"Study of the complex relationship between family dynamics and demanding mill work. Takes as its focus the industrial city of Manchester, New Hampshire, its vast mill complexes of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and the worker families that inhabited its communities and spun its wheels of industrial production. A theoretical look at family in American social history. A discussion of oral history as historical form and methodology. Originally published by Cambridge University Press. From University Press of America: ""The myth that industrialization broke down traditional family ties has long pervaded American society. Professor Hareven, a leading social historian, dispels this myth and illustrates how the family survived and became an active force in the modern factory. In this book, Hareven examines the multiple roles that the workers' families fulfilled in facilitating their adaptation to the pressures of changing work patterns and new modes of life in an industrial city. She reconstructs family and work patterns among immigrants as well as native textile laborers over two generations during a crucial period in the transformation of American industry from the late nineteenth century....A case study based on what was the world's largest textile plant - the Amoskeag Manufacturing Company in Manchester, New Hampshire - the book integrates a wide array of documentary evidence with oral testimony. It examines the lives of real people - the way they acted, the way they perceived their lives, and the kinds of decisions they made when pacing their lives in relation to the demands of the industrial system.""","Hareven, Tamara K.",Preview,Cambridge University Press,1982 (1993),,en,,,,Book,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/7462143"">7462143</a>","19th and 20th centuries; Manchester, New Hampshire",,,,,,,,,,,474,"New York, New York",Cambridge University Press,,9780521289146,,,Family Time and Industrial Time... @ Google Books,,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/29f7921bfbaf7c5d758a05ef62dfd175.jpg,Business and Economics;Community: Customs and Social Life;Ethnicity and Collective Identity;Family;Labor History;Manchester NH;Mills and Mill Work;New Hampshire;Nonfiction;Nonfiction -- History -- Economic and Industrial;Nonfiction -- History -- Labor and Social;Personal History: Biography and Oral History;QuÃ©bec;Social History

1401,Inside Peyton Place : The Life of Grace Metalious,"Biography of Manchester, New Hampshire author Grace Metalious. Famous for her novel ""Peyton Place"" and its various film adaptations. Emily Toth is also the biographer of novelist Kate Chopin.

From University Press of Mississippi: ""The juicy biography of the scandalous novelist who lifted the lid off a New England town...Grace Metalious, an unpretentious housewife from the wrong side of the tracks, had written an explosive bestseller. From a ramshackle cottage in a small New England milltown, she zoomed to national stardom. She met movie stars, famous writers, and the hangers-on who gravitate to those who achieve sudden wealth. She partied with the glamorous; she traveled; always a generous friend, she entertained lavishly. It was a Cinderella dream. But it did not last....Grace refused to be confined by the fifties' notions of a woman's place. In her struggle to find herself, she lifted the lid off sex and violence, power and powerlessness, truth and hypocrisy, and became known as the Pandora in Blue Jeans. 'If I'm a lousy writer,' she said, 'then an awful lot of people have got lousy taste.'...Emily Toth has given us a complete and sympathetic portrait of Grace: the idealistic young scribbler, the partier, the sometimes reluctant wife and mother. Tracing the television shows, the films, the Peyton Place sequels and later novels, Toth shows Grace plagued by periods of self-doubt and loneliness, striving desperately and feeling pressured to create another 'hit.'""

Workers' hobbies, their hangouts, and the impact of their leisure on the workplace and politics in the immigration era. A fresh social history of working-class people not confined to the work space. From Cambridge University Press: ""In the first comprehensive study of American working-class recreation, Professor Rosenzweig takes us to the saloons, the ethnic and church picnics, the parks and playgrounds, the amusement parks, and the movie houses where industrial workers spent their leisure hours. Focusing on the city of Worcester, Massachusetts, he describes the profound changes that popular leisure underwent. Explaining what these pastimes and amusements tell us about the nature of working-class culture and class relations in this era, he demonstrates that in order fully to understand the working class experience it is necessary to explore the realm of leisure. For what workers did in the corner saloon, the neighborhood park, the fraternal lodge hall, the amusement park, and the nickelodeon had a good deal of bearing on what happened inside the factories, the union halls, and the voting booths of America's industrial communities.""","Rosenzweig, Roy",Preview,Cambridge University Press,2002 (1983),,en,,,,Book,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/9154776"">9154776</a>","1870-1920; Worcester, Massachusetts",,,,,,,,,,,304,"New York, New York",,,9780521313971,,,http://www.cambridge.org/gb/knowledge/isbn/item1132701/?site_locale=en_GB;Eight Hours for What We Will... @ Google Books,,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/d40c2cb8f4c1743c9b2536b3d1d3688e.jpg,Alcohol and Drugs;Community: Customs and Social Life;Ethnicity and Collective Identity;Government and Politics;Labor History;Massachusetts;Mills and Mill Work;Nonfiction;Nonfiction -- History -- Labor and Social;Religion;Social History;Sports and Leisure;Worcester MA

1420,The Franco-Americans of New England : Dreams and Realities,"English translation of Yves Roby's ""Les Franco-AmeÌricains de la Nouvelle-Angleterre: ReÌ‚ves et reÌaliteÌs"" - a comprehensive historical text on French Canada's immigrants to New England and their development of a Franco American identity. Covers the period from 1840 (or near the beginning of en masse Canadian emigration) to 1976. One of the most exhaustive texts on Franco Americans to date, Roby's work focuses its attention largely on ""la survivance"" and the prevailing, evolving attitudes toward it in New England. Roby writes, ""This work will attempt to describe the conceptions that the French-Canadian emigrants in New England and their descendants have of themselves.""  From McGill-Queen's University Press: ""Between 1840 and 1930, approximately 900,000 people left Quebec for the United States, with the number of French-Canadian colonies in New England's industrial cities growing rapidly. The first generation of immigrants, who considered themselves French Canadians living in the United States, lived outside of American society as much as possible and sought to recreate their lost motherland. Their children's situation was different, however, since they did not see themselves as a community creating a distinct society on American soil....  What became of these millions of immigrant descendants?... Roby seeks to explain the genesis and evolution of this group and raises insightful questions regarding not only the Franco-Americans but also the integration of ethnocultural groups into Canadian society and the future of North American Francophonies.""","Roby, Yves",Preview,Septentrion,2004,,en (translation),,,,Book,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/57754012"">57754012</a>","1840-1970s; New England, QueÌbec",,,,,,,,,,,543,"Sillery, QueÌbec",,,9782894484005,,,The Franco-Americans of New England... @ McGill-Queen's University Press;http://www.septentrion.qc.ca/catalogue/Livre.asp?id=94,,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/283d8311937e8a56751403e103a9470f.jpg,Adams MA;Bedford NH;Berlin NH;Beverly MA;Boston MA;Bristol CT;Burlington VT;Business and Economics;Cambridge MA;Central Falls RI;Champlain NY;Chelsea MA;Chicopee MA;Community: Customs and Social Life;Criticism and Review;Danielson CT;Emigration and Immigration;Ethnicity and Collective Identity;Farming and Agriculture;Forestry;Gardner MA;Gloucester MA;Haverhill MA;Language and Linguistics;Ludlow MA;Lynn MA;Maine;Massachusetts;Meriden CT;Nashua NH;New England;New Hampshire;Newton MA;Nonfiction;Nonfiction -- History -- General;North Adams MA;North Brookfield MA;Ogdensburg NY;Pittsfield MA;Plattsburgh NY;Portland ME;Prince Edward Island;Providence RI;Putnam CT;QuÃ©bec;Religion;Rhode Island;Salem MA;Southbridge MA;Spencer MA;Springfield MA;St. Albans VT;Suncook NH;Vermont;Waltham MA;Ware MA;Warwick RI;Waterbury CT;Westerly RI;Willimantic CT

This detailed and erudite book maps the major stages of Quebecâ€™s collective development, providing a geographical record of the many social relationships that over time created a sense of place. Landscape, Courville shows, is the keeper of memory, the record of successive changes, and a witness to the genesis of the new. Places that were once agricultural, then left to waste and ruin, are today revivified by tourism. Areas that now house office buildings were long ago open playgrounds where children ruled.

In 1755, English colonial officials forcibly expel close to 10,000 French-speaking Acadians from their lands in Nova Scotia, lands that have been in Acadian hands for almost 150 years. What follows is the epic story of a group of people played as pawns in a struggle between two empires. It is a saga of death and dislocation that reverberates to this day - an event unparalleled in the history of colonization of North America. Drawing from the highly acclaimed series, Canada: A People's History, this one-hour documentary examines the events leading up to the brutal expulsion. Through dramatic re-enactments and interviews with Acadian descendants, it brings to life a human tragedy, one that changed the course of history and established a legacy and culture that lives on to this day.""","Krupa, Grazyna",,,2004,,English and franÃ§ais,,,,TV Broadcast,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/62329002"">62329002</a>","16th century - 21st century, Nova Scotia",,,,,,,Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC),,,00:44:07,,"Toronto, Ontario",,,,,,"http://159.33.1.175/eds_wvx/expulsion.wvx (preview, Windows Media)  http://www.cbcshop.ca/CBC/shopping/product.aspx?Product_ID=ETDOC00116&Variant_ID=6188〈=en-CA",,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/827452c2e71e8d85c4587ef8f668d477.jpg,Acadians;Acculturation and Assimilation;Boston MA;Canada;Community: Customs and Social Life;Death and Disaster;England;France;Genealogy;Louisiana;Massachusetts;Native Americans;New Brunswick;North America;Nova Scotia;Religion;Violence;War

1451,"Shantytowns in the United States, 1820-1890","From the author: ""This dissertation adds a missing piece to the history of the American working class by documenting an overlooked category of low-income housing and the ways in which these self-reliant communities were assigned cultural meanings at odds with their physical form. Using sources that range from photographs and oil paintings to novels and sheet music, the dissertation traces the shanty house type from frontier homesteads to urban shantytowns in turn-of-the-century New York and Brooklyn. It also examines their evolving cultural construction. Presented as domestic by their working-poor builders, shantytowns were nonetheless perceived as degraded by middle-class observers. This had public policy consequences, as shantytowns were razed and outlawed during the last decades of the nineteenth century.""","Goff, Lisa",,,2010-05-00,,en,,,,Thesis/Dissertation,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/703598810"">703598810</a>",1820-1890; United States,,,,,,,,,,,323,"Charlottesville, Virginia",,,,,,Shantytowns... @ University of Virginia;Shantytowns... @ Google Books,,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/3315a03dee90a1a4c18575dda21741b9.jpg,Art and Architecture;Business and Economics;Community: Customs and Social Life;Concord MA;Emigration and Immigration;Irish Americans;Labor History;Lowell MA;Music;New York NY;Nonfiction;Nonfiction -- History -- Labor and Social;Performing Arts;Social History;United States

1457,The Mechanization of Motherhood : Images of Maternity in Quebec Women Writers of the Quiet Revolution,"From AmeriQuests: ""In her short story 'Le Peuplement de la Terre' ('Be Fruitful and Multiply') Madeleine Ferron reveals the reality of married life for generations of women in Quebec whose lives were a constant cycle of pregnancy, childbirth and mothering. Like other Quebec women writers, such as Marie Claire Blais and Gabrielle Roy, Ferron turns on its head the myth of the tireless, dutiful and fulfilled mother, happy to serve God and country by producing offspring. All three of these writers depict motherhood in the period prior to the Quiet Revolution with disturbing images of childbearing automats, leaving us not with a glorified and tender view of motherhood, but rather a mechanization of mothering. Could the preponderance of such imagery in the works of women writers of this period point to attitudes in the medical establishment and in the social agenda of the first half of the 20th century? Using Ferronâ€™s short story as the primary literary example â€“ with parenthetical references to both Une Saison and Bonheur dâ€™Occasion â€“ I provide historical evidence for the increasingly mechanized nature of mothering in Quebec brought on by the ramping up of social, political, religious and economic pressures placed on women in the first part of the 20th century. The historical evidence will take the form of popular literature of health care professionals in Canada and Quebec during this period, as well as the role of the Cercle de FermiÃ¨res, a kind of civic group for rural women of Quebec whose ideology of super-productive women is summed up in their motto, 'Travaillons sans cesse!'

From the preface: ""This booklet was written in an effort to better acquaint Franco-Americans with their outstanding contribution to American life. Indeed, it is partly up to Canadian historians to reveal this heritage to French Canadaâ€™s often neglected and overlooked diaspora. For too long, Franco-Americans have remained the 'forgotten Americans.' This study seeks to help remedy this unfortunate oversight.

1482,The General Textile Strike of 1934 : From Maine to Alabama,"An account of 1934's nationwide textile strike in the United States. The trend of unionization that preceded the strike, and the strike's lasting impact on labor and industry in the United States. A specific focus on the impact of this strike in the industrial pockets of the New England states - often overshadowed by the arguably more widespread effect of labor unrest on life and industry in the American South.  Includes a case study of Burlington, North Carolina, and the textile mills of Burlington Industries. From University of Missouri Press: ""In January 1933, the United Textile Workers of America was in danger of collapse. Its membership was no larger than 15,000; its attempts to organize southern workers had failed disastrously; and it was constantly under attack from rival organizations. Yet, barely eighteen months later, with 300,000 dues-paying members, with newly established or revived branches covering southern cotton textile workers, as well as northern woolen and worsted workers, silk and jacquard weavers, dyers and finishers, even rayon workers, and with locals in 208 cities, towns, and mill villages, UTW was about to embark on what one historian has termed 'the greatest single industrial conflict in the history of American labor.' 'The General Textile Strike of 1934' is the story of that conflict....In 'The General Textile Strike of 1934,' John Salmond tells everyone's story. Looking at the strike from a national and an industrywide perspective, Salmond explains why workers were willing to risk protesting and describes the differences and similarities between southern and northern workers. Setting the strike within a New Deal context and focusing on its impact on the future of labor relations in the industry and on the lives of those who participated in it, 'The General Textile Strike of 1934' fills an important gap in American labor history.""","Salmond, John",Preview,University of Missouri Press,2002,,en,,,,Book,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/56424876"">56424876</a>",1930s; United States,,,,,,,,,,,295,"Columbia, Missouri",University of Missouri Press,,9780826263421,,,The General Textile Strike of 1934... @ Google Books,,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/0c64d1b45984e0cdd8593b71976e2281.jpg,Alabama;Augusta ME;Biddeford ME;Burlington NC;Burlington VT;Business and Economics;Community: Customs and Social Life;Connecticut;Danielson CT;Dighton MA;Easthampton MA;Ethnicity and Collective Identity;Fall River MA;Georgia;Government and Politics;Greenville SC;Hogansville GA;Irish Americans;Italian Americans;Labor History;Lawrence MA;Lewiston ME;Ludlow MA;Maine;Massachusetts;Mills and Mill Work;New Bedford MA;New England;New Hampshire;Newman GA;Nonfiction;Nonfiction -- History -- Economic and Industrial;Nonfiction -- History -- Labor and Social;North Carolina;Pennsylvania;Philadelphia PA;Polish Americans;Portuguese Americans;Putnam CT;Rhode Island;Saco ME;Saylesville RI;Scottish Americans;Social History;South Carolina;Tennessee;Vermont;Violence;Virginia;Willimantic CT;Woonsocket RI

Migration waves and community developments in this region, particularly in Michigan, over hundreds of years. From Michigan State University Press: ""As the first European settlers in Michigan, the French Canadians left an indelible mark on the place names and early settlement patterns of the Great Lakes State. Because of its importance in the fur trade, many French Canadians migrated to Michigan, settling primarily along the Detroit- Illinois trade route, and throughout the fur trade avenues of the Straits of Mackinac. When the British conquered New France in 1763, most Europeans in Michigan were Francophones.

More broadly, I argue that codeswitching must be understood in terms of individual communicative repertoires and community speech economies, particularly as these are tied to a political economic analysis of the relationship between the availability and use of linguistic varieties, on the one hand, and the production and distribution of symbolic and material resources on the other.""","Heller, Monica ",,,1992,,en,,,,Journal Article,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/43413712"">43413712</a>",1978-1990; Canada,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0143-4632,,1 & 2,Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development,http://www.informaworld.com/10.1080/01434632.1992.9994487,13,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/498acf4fb9bda3293bbf2eb0c3d61352.jpg,Canada;Community: Customs and Social Life;Ethnicity and Collective Identity;Government and Politics;Language and Linguistics;Nonfiction;Nonfiction -- Language and Linguistics;Ontario;QuÃ©bec
1521,The Social Consequences of Writing Louisiana French,"The status of French language in Louisiana over time - diversity, amalgamation, decay, revival, and current modes of expression. How the written French word in the context of Louisiana French language revival has taken on special political and social meaning. The written word as a sight for examining the connections between ""social and linguistic change"" in Louisiana. From the author: ""Studies on language shift often refer to the demise of the ousted variety by detailing various stages of language decay and extinction. Problematic for these accounts are well-documented cases of intervening social phenomena, such as language revival movements, which can alter in some way the stages of decline. French Louisiana's situation illustrates language shift interacting with a strong revival movement. In the wake of the revival and in spite of continued shift, another trend is apparent -- the writing of Louisiana French. Whereas shift clearly represents a stage of language decline, the creation of a written code functions as a key ingredient for language maintenance. A sociolinguistic analysis of these forces reveals the complexity and the conflict involved in the choice of the written word.""","Brown, Becky ",,,1993-03,,en; fr,,,,Journal Article,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/484389948"">484389948</a>",17th century - 20th century; Louisiana,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0047-4045,,1,Language in Society,"<a href=""http://www.jstor.org/stable/4168410"">http://www.jstor.org/stable/4168410</a><br />",22,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/8a9a130995ce258d3df793b2bbf1110d.jpg,Acadiana LA;Acadians;Acculturation and Assimilation;Creoles;Demography;Fiction and Literature;France;Government and Politics;Haiti;Language and Linguistics;Louisiana;Native Americans;New Orleans LA;Nonfiction;Nonfiction -- Language and Linguistics;Nova Scotia

Influence of the term ""Cajun"" on the cultural awareness of the Louisiana French, and the impact of Louisiana French cultures on the region's geography. State case-study exploration that provides definitional and territorial figures regarding the term ""Cajun,"" and the changes in these figures and their geography over time.  From the author: ""French Louisiana is the only remnant of France's vast Mississippi Valley empire and its only effectively settled region in the eighteenth century. It remains today one of the most distinctive culture regions of the United States. However, perception of French Louisiana does not reflect its reality. The French population of Louisiana is very diversified in terms of its origins. Despite this diversity, French Louisiana is now usually associated exclusively with Cajuns, a word which until recently was considered derogatory. The beautification of the Cajun identity began to take place in the late 1960s. It was followed by a gradual Cajunization of the white French Louisiana identities and of the regional ethnic territory. However, this process of Cajunization remains incomplete because black Creoles and French-speaking Indians remain unintegrated. Hence, the apparent ethnic homogeneity of French Louisiana, viewed from the outside, contrasts sharply with the cultural variety of its communities.""","TrÃ©panier, CÃ©cyle ",,,1991 July ,,English,,,,Journal Article,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/481914879"">481914879</a>","17th century - 20th century, Louisiana",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0016-7398,,2,The Geographical Journal,http://www.jstor.org/stable/635273  http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/journal.asp?ref=0016-7398,157,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/3b18991e2a56f5d4427025642873e8fd.2,Acadians;Atchafalaya River Valley;Baton Rouge LA;Creoles;Demography;Ethnicity and Collective Identity;Geography;Lafayette LA;Lafourche Parish LA;Language and Linguistics;Louisiana;Marksville LA;Mississippi River Valley;Native Americans;New Orleans LA;Nonfiction;Nonfiction -- Ethnic Studies;Terrebonne Parish LA;Westwego LA
1523,Spoonwood,"The most recent novel in Hebert's acclaimed ""Darby Series,"" depicting realities of family and class in a fictional New Hampshire town. After the death of a young mother in childbirth, and with her wealthy parents seeking custody for the newborn son, a troubled, young working-class father escapes town with his child. From Dartmouth College Press and the University Press of New England: ""After almost fifteen years, Hebert has returned to this rich literary landscape for a new novel of the changing economic and social character of New England. Hebertâ€™s previous Darby novel, 'Live Free or Die,' recounted the ill-fated love between Freddie Elman, son of the town trash collector, and Lilith Salmon, child of Upper Darby gentility. At its conclusion, Lilith died giving birth to their son. As Spoonwood opens, Freddie, consumed by grief and anger and struggling with alcoholism, is not prepared to be a father to Birch. But as both his family and Lilithâ€™s begin to maneuver for custody of the child, Freddie embarks on a course of action that satisfies none of them. Once again, Hebert masterfully conveys the natural and social landscape of contemporary rural New England. Grounded in complex, fully realized characters, Spoonwood offers Hebertâ€™s most optimistic vision yet of acceptance and accommodation across class lines.""","Hebert, Ernest ",,Dartmouth College Press,2005,,English,,,,Book,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/59755997"">59755997</a>",,,,,,,,,,,,320,"Hanover, New Hampshire",,,9781584654902,,,http://www.upne.com/1-58465-490-2.html  Spoonwood @ Google Books (limited preview available)  http://www.ybp.com/acad/features/1105_spoonwood.html,,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/b427f4dfd7cefa988da95cd3878c3edd.jpg,Alcohol and Drugs;Art and Architecture;Caribou ME;Death and Disaster;Family;Fiction and Literature;Frenchville ME;Keene NH;Killington VT;Literary Works -- Fiction;Maine;New England;New Hampshire;New York NY;Vermont;Youth

It is this symbiosis, between social processes usually considered to be contraries, that defines the 'paradox' of ethnicity in the United States"" (16).

This case study of the Fede utilized field work techniques, in-depth interviews and the analysis of archival materials. The objectives of this case study were in brief: (1) to delineate the maintenance activities involved in ethnic persistence; (2) to determine the importance of ethnicity to ethnic group members actively involved in its maintenance; (3) to assess the role of ethnic women in these processes, in order to develop a grounded theory of ethnic persistence.""","D'Andrea, Vaneeta-Marie",Preview,,1986,,en,,,,Thesis,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/16137683"">16137683</a>;<a href="" http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/707101694"">707101694</a>;<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/295684257"">295684257</a>",20th century; New England,,,,,,,,,,,251,"Storrs, Connecticut",,,,,,http://digitalcommons.uconn.edu/dissertations/AAI8629918;The Women of Survivance... @ Google Books,,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/dc9fe4e83625895a1159f665b1e0e2b6.jpg,Acculturation and Assimilation;Community: Customs and Social Life;Demography;Ethnicity and Collective Identity;Family;Gender and Sexuality;Language and Linguistics;Manchester NH;New England;Nonfiction;Nonfiction -- Social Sciences;Nonfiction -- Sociology;QuÃ©bec;Worcester MA

Arguments favoring the particularly modern quality of the dually-authored interview, as compared to outside depictions of Native Americans in the local Maine literatures of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. How early 20th-century Old Town business and local government perpetuated the construction of stereotyped and antiquated Penobscot cultural categories and descriptions - aesthetically, linguistically, or in terms of work and leisure. How the literary output of the Federal Writers' Project played into this sort of identity construction on a more diverse, national scale, and in what ways singular FWP interactions like those between Grady and Mitchell challenged both the national project and the local cultural categories it sometimes reinforced. What the Mitchell/Grady interview owes to the relationship out of which it was born, Grady's other interviews mostly conducted with Franco Americans in Old Town.","Senier, Siobhan",,,2002,,en,"Copyright Â© 2002 The New England Quarterly, Inc.",,,Journal Article,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/480610151"">480610151</a>;<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1759778"">1759778</a>;<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/50709799"">50709799</a>;<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/11168654"">11168654</a>","1930s; Indian Island, Maine; Old Town, Maine; New England",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0028-4866,,3,The New England Quarterly,http://www.jstor.org/stable/1559784,75,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/7c2f2a1881f57edfb8f13bb39a1afe48.jpg,Acculturation and Assimilation;Business and Economics;Emigration and Immigration;Ethnicity and Collective Identity;Government and Politics;Indian Island ME;Maine;Native Americans;New England;Nonfiction;Nonfiction -- History -- Labor and Social;Old Town ME;Penobscots;Personal History: Biography and Oral History;Violence

How studying these nuns in New England adds to an understanding about French Canadian ethnic identity and its real function among New England parishes.  Challenges to a specific French Canadian, Franco American ethnoreligious discourse historically dominated by male priests. Case study of les Petites Franciscaines de Marie (PFM), or the Little Franciscans of Mary, whose religious order was established in Worcester, Massachusetts. From the author: ""[T]his essay will consider how shifting our focus from male church officials to female religious can alter our understanding of the relationship between religious and ethnic identities"" (516). ""Did female religious side with male priests in defending their ethnic turf against bishops whom they perceived as hostile and assimilationist? Alternatively, could nuns not have cared less about connections between their religious identity and their ethnic identity?

1821,Mutational Analyses of Tay-Sachs Disease : Studies on Tay-Sachs Carriers of French Canadian Background Living in New England,"Paper in biochemistry and molecular biology describing certain genetic mutations found in French Canadians and Franco Americans, exploring if or how they relate to the science of Tay-Sachs disease, a genetic disorder causing rapid mental and physical deterioration. From the authors: ""Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) results from mutations in HEXA that cause Hex A deficiency. Heterozygote-screening programs have been applied in groups with an increased TSD incidence, such as Ashkenazi Jews and French Canadians in Quebec. These programs are complicated by benign mutations that cause apparent Hex A deficiency but not TSD. Benign mutations account for only approximately 2% of Jewish and approximately 36% of non-Jewish enzyme-defined carriers. A carrier frequency of 1/53 (n = 1,434) was found in an ongoing prospective analysis of persons of French Canadian background living in New England by using an enzyme-based assay. DNA from enzyme-defined carriers from this population was analyzed to determine the molecular basis of Hex A deficiency. Samples (36) were tested for common mutations, and samples that were negative for these were screened for uncommon or novel mutations by using SSCP analysis. Exons showing mobility shifts were sequenced, and most mutations were confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion. Known disease-causing mutations were found in nine samples (four had a 7.6-kb deletion found in 80% of French Canadian TSD alleles), and known benign mutations were found in four samples. Seven novel changes were identified, including G748A in four samples. The molecular basis of Hex A deficiency in this carrier population differs from that of French Canadian TSD patients. Screening centers should be aware of the presence of benign mutations among U.S. French Canadians or Franco-Americans.""","Triggs-Raine, Barbara;Richard, Melanie;Wasel, Norman;Prence, Elizabeth M.;Natowicz, Marvin R.",,,1995-04,,en,,,,Journal Article,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/679569377"">679569377</a>;<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/117810789"">117810789</a>;<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/199954220"">199954220</a>",1995; New England,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0002-9297,,4,American Journal of Human Genetics,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1801208/ (full text available here),56,,,,,Boston MA;Ethnicity and Collective Identity;Health and Wellness;Illness;New England;Nonfiction;Nonfiction -- Science and Medicine;Waltham MA;Youth
