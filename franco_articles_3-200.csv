Thus, although the title suggests otherwise, it is a story that unfolds primarily within the history of British North America and the United States rather than the new Canadian nation-state. Although cast in large part as an exploration of questions raised by a literature concerning the presence or absence of capitalism in rural North America, Craig's study offers valuable insights to those who have little patience with the transition debate and who believe that wading into that quagmire simply generates more mud(dle).""","Bitterman, Rusty",,,2010 May,,en,,,,Journal Article,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/636583523"">636583523</a>",1780-1875,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0008-3755,,,The Canadian Historical Review,http://utpjournals.metapress.com/content/g16280u02kr1/?sortorder=asc,91,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/d09f7150113d9870e03ad66ffe64076e.jpg,Acculturation and Assimilation;Aroostook County ME;Business and Economics;Canada;Criticism and Review;Demography;Emigration and Immigration;Farming and Agriculture;Forestry;Fur-trading;Labor History;Maine;Native Americans;New Brunswick;New England;Nonfiction;Nonfiction -- History -- Economic and Industrial;St. John River Valley

16,The Spacing of Births Among French-Canadian Families : An Historical Approach,"From the author: ""This article stresses on two aspects of demography. The first aspect is a historical and geographical analysis of the spacing of births among French-Canadians and the second one is the possibilities of using genealogies as sources of data which can yield demographic information. When official computations are not available, the development of demographic data based on family genealogies may give analysts some indication of past performances within societies. Genealogies thus provide a rich source of  information for both Canadian and American historical demographers. When proper methodological techniques are applied to these data, they yield results which then permit one to draw conclusions about demographic behavior. The data for the  present article are derived from a longer study dealing with historical demographic changes among French-Canadians between 1650 and 1950. The genealogy of one French-Canadian family is the source of information utilized in this report. The paper is intended to contribute additional information on changing patterns of child spacing over time and space.""","Bouvier, Leon F.",,,1968-02,,en,,,,Journal Article,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/226000748"">226000748</a>",1650-1950; Canada; United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0008-4948,,#1,The Canadian Review of Sociology and Anthropology,http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1755-618X.1968.tb01166.x/full,5,,,,,Canada;Demography;Family;Genealogy;Nonfiction;Nonfiction -- Anthropology;Nonfiction -- Demography;Nonfiction -- Social Sciences;Nonfiction -- Sociology;Religion

In other words, if a Franco-American at Level 1 (i.e. that level farthest from standard French) succeeds in raising his speech phonetically to Level 2 (i.e. an intermediate level between Level 1 and standard French), his vocabulary will normally reveal a similar degree of switching to modern French.""","Brault, Gerard J.",,,1961-12,,en,,,,Journal Article,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/481209222"">481209222</a>",1950-1960; New England,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0016-111X,,#2,The French Review,http://www.jstor.org/stable/383710,35,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/49bd855cf5416d38f17e34a0bb6fca63.jpg,Acculturation and Assimilation;Language and Linguistics;Maine;Massachusetts;New England;New Hampshire;Nonfiction;Nonfiction -- Language and Linguistics

49,Franco-American Voices : French in the Northeastern United States Today,"From the author: ""This paper describes the current situation of Franco-American French. The discussion is based on interviews with 275 speakers from eight communities: Van Buren, Waterville, and Biddeford, Maine, Berlin, New Hampshire, Southbridge and Gardner, Massachusetts, Bristol, Connecticut, and Woonsocket, Rhode Island. Our analysis confirms that French has not been transmitted to the youngest generations and that its domains of use are highly restricted. Nevertheless, the majority of speakers still use the language often (18%) if not daily (44%).

51,L'identitÃ© franco-amÃ©ricaine : tendances actuelles dans le sud de la Nouvelle-Angleterre,"De Fox, Fortin, Martin, et Stelling: ""Le terme Â«franco-amÃ©ricainâ€‰Â» sâ€™emploie pour dÃ©signer les immigrants canadiens arrivÃ©s au nord-est des Ã‰tats-Unis pendant une pÃ©riode sâ€™Ã©talant de 1840 Ã  1930. Catholiques et francophones, ils y ont Ã©tabli des communautÃ©s resserrÃ©es et un rÃ©seau dâ€™institutions religieuses, scolaires et sociales afin de maintenir leur religion, leur langue, et leur mode de vie traditionnel. Cependant, lâ€™Ã©volution rapide quâ€™a connue ce groupe depuis les soixante derniÃ¨res annÃ©es a dÃ©clenchÃ© un dÃ©bat sur sa dÃ©finition : comment les Franco-AmÃ©ricains se caractÃ©risent-ils actuellementâ€‰?

MÃªme si un grand nombre d'entre-eux utilisent toujours l'Ã©tiquette franco-amÃ©ricaine pour se dÃ©crire, les Franco-AmÃ©ricains se limitent dÃ©sormais Ã  une conception identitaire qui Ã©volue au sein de leur propre communautÃ© sans rÃ©fÃ©rence Ã  une culture supra-communautaire.""","Fox, Cynthia A.;Fortin, GeneviÃ¨ve;Martin, VÃ©ronique;Stelling, Louis",Texte intégral,,2007-01,,en; fr,,,,Article journal,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/365012401"">365012401</a>",1940-2007; New England,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0007-7720,,#1,Canadian Review of American Studies,http://utpjournals.metapress.com/content/q2p24m84367h1n43/?a=9,37,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/fe06f9777d8b3239c62a6cd8d7300927.jpg,Acculturation and Assimilation;Bristol CT;Community: Customs and Social Life;Demography;Gardner MA;Language and Linguistics;New England;Nonfiction;Nonfiction -- Language and Linguistics;Personal History: Biography and Oral History;Southbridge MA;Woonsocket RI

D'Erudit: ""Le prÃ©sent article a pour sujet la genÃ¨se d'une communautÃ© canadienne-franÃ§aise en Nouvelle-Angleterre, celle de Lewiston, Maine, avant 1880. L'auteur dÃ©crit d'abord la localitÃ© Ã  la veille de l'arrivÃ©e des premiers Canadiens franÃ§ais en I860, s'attardant plus particuliÃ¨rement aux bouleversements causÃ©s par la RÃ©volution industrielle, qui fit de Lewiston un des plus importants centres textiles des Ã‰tats-Unis. Il explique ensuite la nature des migrations canadiennes-franÃ§aises au 19e siÃ¨cle, et le rÃ´le de premier plan qu'y jouaient la famille et la parentÃ©. De fait, la famille Ã©tait la cellule de base de la communautÃ© ethnique en formation.

58,French Canada's Search for a Homeland : A Literary Perspective,"Gill explores French Canadian societies through the lens of its literatures, particularly those coming from Quebec. He introduces his efforts with a brief illustration of the rise and fall of New France, where he claims that French Canadians have been left in a position of political defeat (whether or not they choose to accept it as such) for almost two centuries, and thus in a constant struggle for survival through the establishment of a political homeland. Up until recently, says Gill, the French Canadian search for such a home has been bolstered by the linguistic, religious, and otherwise cultural principles of ""la survivance,"" and has been crucial to the persistence of Francophone Quebec. Oftentimes, as Gill will also point out, ""la survivance"" has been trumped more confidently by a ""rayonnement,"" or a principal desire to spread one's own culture. We these ideas in mind, Gill traces the French Canadian experiences of political defeat and cultural persistence - the search for and development of a ""homeland"" - through their telling literatures. We see a fallen New France and a rising Quebec through images in fiction.","Gill, Robert M.",,,1978 Autumn,,,,,,Journal Article,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/60621291"">60621291</a>","1600-1970, Quebec in literature",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1943-9954,,#2,American Review of Canadian Studies,http://www.acsus.org,8,,,,,Acculturation and Assimilation;Canada;Criticism and Review;Ethnicity and Collective Identity;Exploration and Colonization;Farming and Agriculture;Fiction and Literature;France;Fur-trading;Government and Politics;Literary Works -- Criticism and History;New England;QuÃ©bec;Religion;War

70,Standards and Local Curriculum : A Zero-Sum Game?,"Function and impact of Maine Learning Results educational plan in elementary schools of rural Maine. Includes a segment on Walters School in the St. John Valley, and discusses its elementary French language program as it becomes incorporated in MLR methods. From the author: ""Many rural educators and researchers have not embraced standards-based reform warmly. Some are wary of standards driving out unique and locally responsive curriculum. Others cast standards as one more example of a reform largely geared toward urban and suburban schools but foisted on rural schools regardless of applicability. These arguments are mostly rhetorical. Few studies have looked at the effects ofstandards' implementation on the classroom practices of rural educators. In this paper, I examine the impact ofa state standards-based reform, the Maine Learning Results, on curriculum and instruction in four rural schools. I focus on the impact that standards have on locally responsive curriculum in the schools. I suggest that state standards and locally responsive curriculum ultimately may not be as incompatible as many scholars and practitioners suggest.""","Jennings, Nancy E.",,,2000 Winter,,,,,,Journal Article,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/425331644"">425331644</a>",1990-2000; Maine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8756-0534,,#3,Journal of Research in Rural Education,"http://www.jrre.psu.edu/articles/v16,n3,p193-201,Jennings.pdf (full text available here)",16,,,,,Education;Language and Linguistics;Maine;Midcoast Region ME;Nonfiction;Nonfiction -- Education;Quarry Island ME;Scofield ME;St. John River Valley

From census data, it will be shown that two-thirds of Canada's population live in English dominated regions, within which minorities of all other languages are dwindling through assimilation, but that there is also a French Canada, within which it is the use of the English language that is declining.

Rather it is a symbol of French Canadian culture adopted during the period between the 1880s and 1930s when French valley residents were eager to assert their â€œFranco-Americanâ€ identity. The Madawaska twin barn displays some affinity to American barns in Aroostook County and particularly the Yankee symbol, the connecting barn. However, its appearance is also French Canadian. The distribution of the twin barn defines an area of French Canadian and American interaction which remains distinct.""","Konrad, Victor A.;Chaney, Michael",,,1982 September,,,,,,Journal Article,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/43321549"">43321549</a>","1880-1982, Upper St. John Valley, Maine",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0887-3631,,#1,Journal of Cultural Geography,http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/titles/08873631.asp,3,,,,,Acculturation and Assimilation;Art and Architecture;Ethnicity and Collective Identity;Farming and Agriculture;Forestry;Madawaska ME;Nonfiction;Nonfiction -- Art and Architecture;Personal History: Biography and Oral History;Social History;St. John River Valley

Using data from a New England industrial community, I trace the connection between this transition and the growth and decline of the textile industry, the incorporation of immigrants into a hierarchical production process, and family strategies for allocating productive and reproductive labor. While the era of working daughters left the allocation of reproductive labor (housework and child care) intact, the wage work of recent immigrant mothers has had a more profound impact on families by reallocating some of 'women's work.' Nevertheless, many families have continued to maintain an ideology that values the husband's authority, emphasizes respect for parents, and stresses differences between men and women, all of these in the face of considerable changes in actual behavior.""","Lamphere, Louise",,,1986 February,,en,,,,Journal Article,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/482347183"">482347183</a>",1900-1986; Rhode Island,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,#1,,http://www.jstor.org/stable/644590,13,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/917f699210481b980db0a54aacef1d97.jpg,Business and Economics;Demography;Emigration and Immigration;Ethnicity and Collective Identity;Gender and Sexuality;Labor History;Mills and Mill Work;Mossasuck River Valley;New England;Nonfiction;Nonfiction -- History -- Labor and Social;Pawtucket RI;Providence RI;Rhode Island;Weaverton RI;Wierville RI

In examining textual sources through which New England French-Canadians have imagined their affinities and differences in relation to other ethnic groups and nationalities, from the mid-19th century up to the present day (e.g., Tremblay, Beaugrand, Kerouac, Plante, Proulx), an alternative model for the 21st century emerges: a politics of alterity in which an increasingly fragile 'microethnic' memory continues to be rearticulated across linguistic and national borders to serve as a parallel narrative to metropolitan discourses of identity, exceptionalism and survivance.""","Larkosh, Christopher ",,,2006 Fall,,FranÃ§ais and English,,,,Journal Article,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/243540416"">243540416</a>","1850-2006, New England",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1206-0143,,#16,TOPIA: Canadian Journal of Cultural Studies,http://pi.library.yorku.ca/ojs/index.php/topia/article/view/13271 (full text available here),,,,,,Acculturation and Assimilation;Ethnicity and Collective Identity;Language and Linguistics;New England;QuÃ©bec;United States

Hamon envisioned a peaceful conquest of New England by a surplus French-Canadian population, capable of resisting Americanization, laboring in the mills, and farming the countryside.

89,A French-Canadian Education and the Persistence of 'La Franco-AmÃ©ricanie',"From the author: ""The migration of one million French Canadians from QuÃ©bec to the United States between 1840 and 1940 was different from the migrations of other ethnic groups. The proximity of QuÃ©bec made possible the maintenance of intimate social and cultural relationships between emigrants and their homeland.

99,Resisting the Melting Pot : The Long Term Impact of Maintaining Identity for Franco-Americans in New England,"From MacKinnon and Parent - Department of Economics, McGill University: ""In this paper, we look at the emigration of approximately 1 million French-Canadians who moved to the United States, with the bulk of the migration occurring between the end of the Civil War and 1930 and with most settling in neighboring New England. What makes this episode particularly interesting is the fact that the French-Canadian immigrants exerted considerable efforts to maintain their language and to replicate their home century institutions, most notably the schooling system, in their new country. This explicit resistance to assimilation generated considerable attention and concern in the U.S. over many years.... We look at the convergence in the educational attainment of French Canadian immigrants across generations relative to native English-speaking New Englanders and to other immigrants....Additionally, we show that military service was a very important factor contributing to the assimilation process through a variety of related channels, namely educational attainment, language assimilation, marrying outside the ethnic group, and moving out of New England. Finally, when we compare Franco-Americans to French-speaking Canadians of the same generations, it is clear that Franco-Americans substantially upgraded their educational attainment relative to what it would have been if they had not emigrated.""","MacKinnon, Mary;Parent, Daniel",Full text,,2005-06,,en,,,,Journal Article,,1860-2005; New England,,,,,,,,,CIRPEE Working Paper,,63,,,,,05-17,,http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=739627 (full text available here),,,,,,Acculturation and Assimilation;Business and Economics;Canada;Demography;Education;Emigration and Immigration;Ethnicity and Collective Identity;Fall River MA;Holyoke MA;Language and Linguistics;Mexico;New England;Nonfiction;Nonfiction -- Education;Nonfiction -- Immigration;Nonfiction -- Social Sciences;QuÃ©bec;Religion;United States;War

Kerouac's arrested Oedipal narratives and his related myth of Native Canadian ancestry lead to ambivalent identifications with black subjects, who exhibit characteristics that more properly belong to Kerouac's mother. These identifications exhibit a fetishistic play of presence and absence. Accordingly, Kerouac's racechanges are unstable formations designed to consolidate an ethnic minority writer's American national identity, his autochthonous link to a gendered landscape and his volatile sexuality.

102,"Writing as a Form of 'Survival' in Franco-America : Translingualism, Memory, and Identity in Robert B.

American literature in languages other than English engages with this dialogue, though the nature of this engagement is rarely given appropriate recognition in American Studies. As a step towards redressing this neglect, this article focuses on two contemporary Franco-American writers, both third-generation immigrants, Normand BeauprÃ© and Robert B. Perreault, who choose to write in the language of their ancestors, French. In doing so, they not only cope with a pride rooted in la survivance, the ideology that used to define their community, but also attempt to link their narrative to a QuÃ©bec storytelling tradition. In choosing to express themselves in their native French, they try to demarginalize it and to bring their native voice back to the center. Their works also aim at tackling the issue of code-switching, of working with a mixed and impure language â€“ an issue which has forced many Franco-American novelists to write in English rather than in French.""","Pacini, Peggy",,,2006 September,,,,,,Journal Article,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/441582875"">441582875</a>","1970-2006, New England",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1477-5700,,#3,Comparative American Studies,http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/maney/cas/2006/00000004/00000003/art00008,4,,,,,Community: Customs and Social Life;Emigration and Immigration;Ethnicity and Collective Identity;Fiction and Literature;Language and Linguistics;Literary Works -- Criticism and History;New England;QuÃ©bec

In his bestselling autobiographical novel, 'On the Road,' Kerouac splits his ethnic (French) and national (American) sides into two figures, Sal and Dean, to demonstrate the deficits and benefits of both parts of a hyphenated identity. Italian Sal sees himself as the eternal outsider, whereas Dean is America itself. Yet Sal uses his outsider qualities to connect with other outsiders whose 'roots' are beyond the limits of nationhood. And Dean, despite the seemingly endless freedom of his 'routes' across the country, is stuck in old tropes of Americanness that do not afford him new possibilities. Together, they create a vision of America that is full of its own grandeur, while refusing to be insular.","Skinazi, Karen E.H.",,,2009,,,,,,Journal Article,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/630694433"">630694433</a>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0007-7720,,#1,Canadian Review of American Studies,http://www.utpjournals.com/cras/cras.html,39,,,,,Criticism and Review;Ethnicity and Collective Identity;Fiction and Literature;Literary Works -- Criticism and History;Lowell MA;Pawtucketville MA;Travel and Movement;United States
133,Novelists and Ethnicity : Jack Kerouac and Grace Metalious as Franco-Americans,"In this short piece, Richard Sorrell casts early twentieth-century writers Jack Kerouac and Grace Metalious into the timeline of Franco-American ethnic integration. Sorrell attempts to illustrate the relationship between these writers' works and their backgrounds, with many a turbid novel coming out of the struggle between Franco-American identity development and French-Canadian survivance. From Sorrell: ""What possible line could there be between the man who wrote 'On the Road,' one of the founders of the 'beat' generation, and the crass promoter of lurid best-sellers such as 'Peyton Place?' The thesis of this essay is that such a connection can be found in a little-appreciated bond between the two authors, their common ethnic background. Kerouac and Metalious came from a heritage whose basic cultural attributes (maintenance of traditional nationality and religion, and militant defense of conservatism, Catholicism, and the family) seem to be in conflict with the popular image of both writers.""

143,Vermont and the Imaginative Geographies of American Whiteness,"From the author: ""The U.S. state of Vermont is often portrayed as a place where 'race' is of little significance, yet notions of whiteness are central to how the state has been represented and represents itself. A critical analysis of historical and contemporary economies of representation examines how Vermont has been imagined as one of the last remaining spaces of authentic Yankee whiteness while more recently becoming an imagined homeland for particular brands of white liberal politics and social practice in the United States. Narratives of white Vermont identity have often explicitly drawn on oppositions to other forms of whiteness, particularly those associated with the U.S. South, in constructing an image of a comparatively racially benign Yankee whiteness. Recent right-wing discourses have explicitly attempted to construct Vermont whiteness as outside the American mainstream (not least through its discursive association with gay and lesbian sexualities), suggesting a need for geographical work on the (re)configuration of whiteness to reconsider where 'normal' American whiteness is imagined to reside. The examination of the case of Vermont highlights the need for future geographical research to attend to continuities between various territorialized constructions of whiteness as well as contestations within whiteness.""","Vanderbeck, Robert M.",,,2006,,,,,,Journal Article,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/441291955"">441291955</a>","1860-2007, Vermont, United States",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0004-5608,,3,Annals of the Association of American Geographers,http://www.jstor.org/stable/4124437,96,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/9f8cc291db5cd141ba70b680c1f571d0.jpg,Burlington VT;Ethnicity and Collective Identity;Gender and Sexuality;Geography;Government and Politics;New England;Nonfiction;Nonfiction -- Geography;United States;Vermont

While popular imagery associates French Canadian population growth in QuÃ©bec with very large family sizes and with the outmigration of anglophones, no studies currently exist which attempt to measure the relative impact of each factor.

She uses the examples of Lewiston, Maine, and Worcester, Massachusetts, and the different economies therein to ultimately observe the impact of a certain migration on the traditions (oppressive or otherwise) of a people. From the text: ""My argument is twofold: on one hand, for male leaders in these migrant communities, perpetuating traditional ideas about men's and women's contributions to family and society was part of an effort to retain, on a communal level, their distinct identity as a Catholic people of French Canadian ancestry. In contrast, for female migrants, the decision to support traditional gender norms was a more complicated one; many migrant women and their American-born daughters advocated perpetuation of traditional Quebecois understandings of gender not only as a means of defining their place in American society, as Catholic women of French Canadian ancestry, but also to obtain and maintain the benefits and status within the home that these ideals afforded them in the United States.""","Waldron, FlorenceMae",,,2005,,en,,,,Journal Article,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/480449413"">480449413</a>",1870-1930; New England,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1536-0334,,#2,Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies,"http://www.nebraskapress.unl.edu/product/Frontiers,673226.aspx",26,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/a3cef903ccb3d7aec671c78cba4bf61a.jpg,Acculturation and Assimilation;Auburn ME;Community: Customs and Social Life;Emigration and Immigration;Family;Folklore;Gender and Sexuality;Labor History;Language and Linguistics;Lewiston ME;Manchester NH;Mills and Mill Work;New England;Nonfiction;Nonfiction -- History -- Labor and Social;Nonfiction -- Immigration;QuÃ©bec;Religion;Social History;Winchendon MA;Worcester MA

Consequently, working-class violence, rather than being directed at the manufacturer, was directed at the ranks of the unemployed ready to claim their jobs.

It argues that the postcolonial experiences of the former colonies of England and France in the Americas, particularly the United States and French Canada, have been primarily conditioned by their relations to each other and not by their relations to the former colonizing power.
