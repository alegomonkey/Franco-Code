From the author: ""'Growing Up On Academy Hill' honors [King's] father who encouraged all six of his children to finish high school, a not-so-common achievement for those hard times. Recalling his ideology Annette wrote: 'My father was born with an inexhaustible desire to feel the earth passing through his fingers, to smell newly plowed fields warmed by sunlight. Every spring he pointed joyfully to new beginnings, and with enthusiasm taught us the basics of all beauty. From one corner of a small piece of land to the other, we observed as children, life through his eyes.' A brother's thoughts: 'We were not from a very touchy-feely"" kind of family. However, our parents were not unloving, it was simply an unspoken love that was shared. I never heard Papa say, ""I love you"" to my mother, my sisters, or me. I never saw Papa kiss Mama. Yet the feeling of love was pervasive when I was a child.'""

It Stops with Me : Memoir of a Canuck Girl,"From Touch Art Books: ""This story with its bold contrasts of good and bad, love and hate, inextricably connected, is situated in the context of the bigger history of French Canadian and Indian people amid mainstream American culture from the mid 1950s to the edge of the 21st century....Touchette&rsquo;s story is rooted deep in the past in her parents', grandparents', and great-grandparents' experiences. Rooted in a changing, dying culture, and a community with a complex history, her mixed heritage held good and bad. With coal black eyes, Indian hair, French language, and woman-centered culture, she inherited a legacy of oppression and denial overshadowed by the powerful influence of the Catholic Church. But Touchette chose a different legacy for her children and the seven generations to follow that connected her to 5000 years of Jewish traditions, and milleniums of Native American spirituality."" Also from Touch Art Books: ""A visionary American painter examines an eventful life that spans fifty years, several cultures -- French Canadian, Indian and Jewish, and diverse places -- from Wellesley College, New York's Lower East Side, and Soho, to Indian Country, Navajo Nation and Santa Fe, New Mexico. Stories of families -- their agony and blessings, shame and pride, destruction and creation -- with brilliant illustrations, demonstrate the depth and resiliency of the human spirit, and make the personal, universal.

Use My Name: Jack Kerouac's Forgotten Families,"From ECW Press: ""With this fascinating new book, Jim Jones debunks many of the myths surrounding the life and times of Jack Kerouac. Jones concentrates on those whose lives were most affected by Kerouac: daughter Jan Kerouac, wives Edie Parker, Joan Haverty, and Stella Sampas, as well as nephew Paul Blake Jr. 'Use My Name: Jack Kerouac's Forgotten Families' takes its title from advice given to Jan during her second and final meeting with Jack, who encouraged her to profit from the surname she shared with the famous author of 'On the Road.' Sadly, not one of these individuals so closely tied to Kerouac seems to have benefited from the connection, as Jones discovers in his in-depth interview with Jan. She discusses at length her 15 months as a prostitute, her own divorces, her hospitalization, and her life as an author, including a wild European book tour for [her novel] 'Baby Driver.' Although Kerouac is one of the most 'biographied' American writers of our time, Jones offers a new perspective on the King of the Beats and his generation, one in which formerly marginalized figures in the Kerouac storyparticularly womenbecome strong, central characters. He also exposes the cut-throat wheeling and dealing that has plagued the Kerouac estate and that continues today as the various players do battle over the legacy of one of the counterculture's biggest idols.""","Jones, James T.",,ECW Press,1999,,English,,,,Book,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/40735081"">40735081</a>",,,,,,,,,,,,203,"Toronto, Ontario",,,9.78155E+12,,,"<div class=""element-text""><a href=""http://www.ecwpress.com/books/use_my_name"">http://www.ecwpress.com/books/use_my_name</a> <br/><br/> <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=9s5uS7n_6FoC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s"">Use My Name... @ Google Books</a> (limited preview available here)</div>",,,,,,Alcohol and Drugs;Criticism and Review;Death and Disaster;Family;Fiction and Literature;Gender and Sexuality;Illness;Literary Works -- Criticism and History;New Mexico;New York NY;Personal History: Biography and Oral History,Biographies & Autobiographies

Little Canuck : The Adventures of an Immigrant Boy from Québec,"Self-published memoir about life in Québec, and life after Québec. From iUniverse: ""Michel learns that his father is dying. This news precipitates a nostalgic journey into the past-a childhood spent on a dairy farm in French Québec. As a sensitive boy secluded from the world, Michel wavers between forbidden exploits and heartbreaking tribulations. Catholic school is a culture shock, but it's the huge pumpkin-shaped teacher with a bad temper who terrorizes his brain most. On the farm, his young life abounds with fun and danger-mad bulls, dynamite sticks, runaway darts, lethal ice cubes, and hazardous farm equipment. After struggling with a dismal economy, his family is forced to abandon their home. They desert their isolated farmhouse and move into a cockroach-infested apartment in an English-speaking city one mile from the seductive United States border. There, Michel copes with bullies, Russian spies, and ghosts. 'Little Canuck' recounts the humorous, and at times, heartrending memoirs of a young boy on his journey through a colorful landscape of emotion. Along the way, young Michel uncovers the mysteries of female anatomy, and learns poignant truths about mortality. His most profound lessons are not learned at school.

"Destination Madawaska : Biographie de Charles Terrieau, pionnier acadien ","From the author: ""The book is a biography of Charles Theriault, first francophone settler in 1821-1823 of the lower Madawaska River in present-day St-Jacques. The book presents a brief history of the Acadian migration before the time of Charles' trail-blazing in the wilderness of the Madawaska territory. The territory at that time was a no-man's land' that included much of northern Maine from Houlton and all of Madawaska county and parts of Victoria and Restigouche counties of northwestern New Brunswick. At that time, the territory was claimed by the United States as being part of the new state of Maine and was also claimed by England as being part of the new colony of New Brunswick. The dispute was settled by the Webster-Ashburton Treaty of 1842 which  chose the St-John River as the international boundary separating the United States and New Brunswick. The book presents the genealogy of the greater Thériault family in the St-John Valley showing that the population of all Thériaults until 1900 came from three branches of the Acadian family; one which migrated from the lower St-John to St-Basile around 1790 and two branches which had migrated from Acadia to Kamouraska, QC in 1759 and later migrated to the various Madawaska settlements between 1820 and 1860.""","Thériault, J.R.T.

Inside Peyton Place : The Life of Grace Metalious,"Biography of Manchester, New Hampshire author Grace Metalious. Famous for her novel ""Peyton Place"" and its various film adaptations. Emily Toth is also the biographer of novelist Kate Chopin.

From University Press of Mississippi: ""The juicy biography of the scandalous novelist who lifted the lid off a New England town...Grace Metalious, an unpretentious housewife from the wrong side of the tracks, had written an explosive bestseller. From a ramshackle cottage in a small New England milltown, she zoomed to national stardom. She met movie stars, famous writers, and the hangers-on who gravitate to those who achieve sudden wealth. She partied with the glamorous; she traveled; always a generous friend, she entertained lavishly. It was a Cinderella dream. But it did not last....Grace refused to be confined by the fifties' notions of a woman's place. In her struggle to find herself, she lifted the lid off sex and violence, power and powerlessness, truth and hypocrisy, and became known as the Pandora in Blue Jeans. 'If I'm a lousy writer,' she said, 'then an awful lot of people have got lousy taste.'...Emily Toth has given us a complete and sympathetic portrait of Grace: the idealistic young scribbler, the partier, the sometimes reluctant wife and mother. Tracing the television shows, the films, the Peyton Place sequels and later novels, Toth shows Grace plagued by periods of self-doubt and loneliness, striving desperately and feeling pressured to create another 'hit.'""
