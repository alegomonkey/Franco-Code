French Canada's Search for a Homeland : A Literary Perspective,"Gill explores French Canadian societies through the lens of its literatures, particularly those coming from Quebec. He introduces his efforts with a brief illustration of the rise and fall of New France, where he claims that French Canadians have been left in a position of political defeat (whether or not they choose to accept it as such) for almost two centuries, and thus in a constant struggle for survival through the establishment of a political homeland. Up until recently, says Gill, the French Canadian search for such a home has been bolstered by the linguistic, religious, and otherwise cultural principles of ""la survivance,"" and has been crucial to the persistence of Francophone Quebec. Oftentimes, as Gill will also point out, ""la survivance"" has been trumped more confidently by a ""rayonnement,"" or a principal desire to spread one's own culture. We these ideas in mind, Gill traces the French Canadian experiences of political defeat and cultural persistence - the search for and development of a ""homeland"" - through their telling literatures. We see a fallen New France and a rising Quebec through images in fiction.","Gill, Robert M.",,,1978 Autumn,,,,,,Journal Article,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/60621291"">60621291</a>","1600-1970, Quebec in literature",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1943-9954,,#2,American Review of Canadian Studies,"<div class=""element-text""><a href=""http://www.acsus.org"">http://www.acsus.org</a></div>",8,,,,,Acculturation and Assimilation;Canada;Criticism and Review;Ethnicity and Collective Identity;Exploration and Colonization;Farming and Agriculture;Fiction and Literature;France;Fur-trading;Government and Politics;Literary Works -- Criticism and History;New England;Québec;Religion;War,Literary Works | Oeuvres littéraires

The Melting Pot That Boiled Over : Racial Fetishism and the Lingua Franca of Jack Kerouac's Fiction,"From the author: ""The racechanges in Jack Kerouac's fiction originate in racial fetishism. Kerouac's arrested Oedipal narratives and his related myth of Native Canadian ancestry lead to ambivalent identifications with black subjects, who exhibit characteristics that more properly belong to Kerouac's mother. These identifications exhibit a fetishistic play of presence and absence. Accordingly, Kerouac's racechanges are unstable formations designed to consolidate an ethnic minority writer's American national identity, his autochthonous link to a gendered landscape and his volatile sexuality. When Kerouac's fiction is read in 'translation,' his joual mother-tongue dramatises a psychosexual crisis in national belonging.""","Nicholls, Brendon",,,2003,,en,,,,Journal Article,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/364620388"">364620388</a>",1935-1967; United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0026-7724,,#3,Modern Fiction Studies,"<div class=""element-text""><a href=""http://www.cla.purdue.edu/english/mfs/"">http://www.cla.purdue.edu/english/mfs/</a></div>",49,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/3421763a7f7ca0dcc844f0e74c102524.jpg,Criticism and Review;Ethnicity and Collective Identity;Fiction and Literature;Gender and Sexuality;Language and Linguistics;Literary Works -- Criticism and History;Lowell MA,Literary Works | Oeuvres littéraires

Through Roots and Routes : On the Road's Portrayal of an Outsider's Journey into the Meaning of America,"From Skinazi: ""This paper will show that, in 'On the Road,' Kerouac reflects on what it is to be a Franco-American manboth American and not....Jack Kerouac believed that his French Canadian roots held the key to his knowledge, despite the fact that he became known as the 'principal avatar' of a generation of American youth. In his bestselling autobiographical novel, 'On the Road,' Kerouac splits his ethnic (French) and national (American) sides into two figures, Sal and Dean, to demonstrate the deficits and benefits of both parts of a hyphenated identity. Italian Sal sees himself as the eternal outsider, whereas Dean is America itself. Yet Sal uses his outsider qualities to connect with other outsiders whose 'roots' are beyond the limits of nationhood. And Dean, despite the seemingly endless freedom of his 'routes' across the country, is stuck in old tropes of Americanness that do not afford him new possibilities. Together, they create a vision of America that is full of its own grandeur, while refusing to be insular.","Skinazi, Karen E.H.",,,2009,,,,,,Journal Article,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/630694433"">630694433</a>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0007-7720,,#1,Canadian Review of American Studies,"<div class=""element-text""><a href=""http://www.utpjournals.com/cras/cras.html"">http://www.utpjournals.com/cras/cras.html</a></div>",39,,,,,Criticism and Review;Ethnicity and Collective Identity;Fiction and Literature;Literary Works -- Criticism and History;Lowell MA;Pawtucketville MA;Travel and Movement;United States,Literary Works | Oeuvres littéraires
Novelists and Ethnicity : Jack Kerouac and Grace Metalious as Franco-Americans,"In this short piece, Richard Sorrell casts early twentieth-century writers Jack Kerouac and Grace Metalious into the timeline of Franco-American ethnic integration. Sorrell attempts to illustrate the relationship between these writers' works and their backgrounds, with many a turbid novel coming out of the struggle between Franco-American identity development and French-Canadian survivance. From Sorrell: ""What possible line could there be between the man who wrote 'On the Road,' one of the founders of the 'beat' generation, and the crass promoter of lurid best-sellers such as 'Peyton Place?' The thesis of this essay is that such a connection can be found in a little-appreciated bond between the two authors, their common ethnic background. Kerouac and Metalious came from a heritage whose basic cultural attributes (maintenance of traditional nationality and religion, and militant defense of conservatism, Catholicism, and the family) seem to be in conflict with the popular image of both writers.""

"Postcolonialism in North America : Imaginative Colonization in Henry Thoreau's ""A Yankee in Canada"" and Jacques Poulin's ""Volkswagen Blues""","From the author:""This thesis introduces the concept of imaginative colonization in postcolonial literary and cultural studies, which has a particular relevance to the literatures of North America. It argues that the postcolonial experiences of the former colonies of England and France in the Americas, particularly the United States and French Canada, have been primarily conditioned by their relations to each other and not by their relations to the former colonizing power. Imaginative colonization occurs when one former colony, using the means of the cross-border narrative and/or the postmodern recuperation of history, reimagines another not as an autonomous cultural entity, but as a feature of its own history, language, ideology, and even cartography.""","Weisman, Adam Paul",,,1995-fall,,en,,,,Journal Article,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/482967897"">482967897</a>",1800-present; Canada; United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0025-4878,,#3,The Massachusetts Review,"<div class=""element-text""><a href=""http://www.jstor.org/stable/25090664"">www.jstor.org/stable/25090664</a></div>",36,,,,,Canada;Criticism and Review;Emigration and Immigration;Fiction and Literature;Government and Politics;Literary Works -- Criticism and History;Québec;United States,Literary Works | Oeuvres littéraires

What Became of Them and Other Stories from Franco-America,"Ledoux has woven a tapestry of vignettes all coming to a seam at self-reflection. 'What Became of Them' is a collection of short stories that spans a century of Franco America, its cultural mutations, and its burdening self-absorption. Ledoux finds a way to unite spousal estrangement, Catholic suppression, working-class embarrassment, and the tragedy of leaving things behind in a sometimes less-than-latent nostalgia for those things that could have been; he breaks it all down in his charactersâ' even stronger drive to move forward. â€œWhenever I stopped using other peopleâ's words,â€ Ledouxâ's young seminarian character muses on prayer, â€œthere was always a stillness, a withered silence.â€ Ledoux takes this point to heart and, in this collection, subverts it â€“ breaking the withered silence with hopes and fears of a cultural sort little heard in literature.  â€œThe artist is a priest,â€ says Ledouxâ's same character: a priest anew. And so is Ledoux here, writing out prayers of a bold and freeing kind, in a language audible to a world in- and outside of Franco America. Contains the following stories: Germaine (also featured in Puckerbrush Review, le Canado-Americain, Le F.A.R.O.G.

Why Kerouac Matters : The Lessons of On the Road,"Critical study of Jack Kerouac's ""On the Road"" through the lens of its author and one of its main characters.
From Viking Press: ""In 'Why Kerouac Matters,' John Leland embarks on a wry, insightful, and playful discussion of the novel ['On the Road'], arguing that it still matters because at its core it is a book that is full of lessons about how to grow up. Leland's focus is on Sal Paradise, the Kerouac alter ego, who has always been overshadowed by his fictional running buddy Dean Moriarty. Leland examines the lessons that Paradise absorbs and dispenses on his novelistic journey to manhood, and how those lessons about work and money, love and sex, art and holiness still reverberate today. He shows how 'On the Road' is a primer for male friendship and the cultivation of traditional family values, and contends that the stereotype of the two wild and crazy guys obscures the novels core themes of the search for atonement, redemption, and divine revelation. 'Why Kerouac Matters' offers a new take on Kerouac's famous novel, overturning many misconceptions about it and making clear the themes Kerouac was trying to impart.""","Leland, John",,Viking,2007,,English,,,,Book,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/83758819"">83758819</a>","20th century, United States",,,,,,,,,,,205,"New York, New York",,,,,,"<div class=""element-text""><a href=""http://us.penguingroup.com/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9780143114376,00.html?Why_Kerouac_Matters_John_Leland"">http://us.penguingroup.com/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9780143114376,00.html?Why_Kerouac_Matters_John_Leland</a> <br/><br/> <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=ezX7R0dy02EC&amp;dq=leland%3B+why+kerouac+matters&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s"">http://books.google.com/books?id=ezX7R0dy02EC&amp;dq=leland%3B+why+kerouac+matters&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s</a> (limited preview available here)</div>",,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/e4e1892cecb6f8e6c8f270912113ecfb.jpg,Alcohol and Drugs;Criticism and Review;Denver CO;Family;Fiction and Literature;Gender and Sexuality;Literary Works -- Criticism and History;New England;New York NY;Personal History: Biography and Oral History;San Francisco CA,Literary Works | Oeuvres littéraires

The Miracle: A Novel,"From Grove/Atlantic Press: ""John Lâ'Heureux has been acclaimed as '[a] master storyteller . . . elegant, cunning, and wickedly funny' (The Washington Post). Now, in a pitch-perfect, deeply satisfying work of fiction, he enters the world of an unorthodox young priest whose faith is put to the test. Father Paul LeBlanc is young, handsome, and charismatic. He has just been transferred out of Boston because of his dangerous ideas on sex, marriage, and birth control and because he just doesnâ't uphold the decorum expected of a young priest. Exiled to a summer beach community, he looks after elderly Father Moriarty, an unlikely saint who, on the edge of death, is beginning to question his belief in God. Father LeBlanc goes on preaching his edgy homilies, making his efficient way on the path to sanctity. Then Rose Perez and Annaka Malley enter his life, looking, each in her own way, for answers. When, for no reason, a miracle occurs a dead girl is brought back to life before his eyes Father LeBlanc finds his faith and his vows, his reason, his life itself, all called into question, leaving him with nowhere to turn. Witty, profound, and deeply moving, 'The Miracle' explores the way God meddles in our lives...and to what end. It examines with great wisdom and gentle insight how best man can serve his spirit. 'The Miracle' is John L'Heureuxâ's finest, most daring novel.""

Candles on Bay Street,"A Fort Kent, Maine, novel by author K.C. McKinnon (a pseudonym for the writer Cathie Pelletier). From Fantastic Fiction: ""In 'Candles on Bay Street,' K. C. McKinnon immerses readers in the rhythms of small-town life in Fort Kent, Maine, a close-knit community that finds many of its most cherished beliefs thrown into question when a hometown girl returns after a long absence. The narrator is Sam Thibodeau, the town veterinarian, whose world is turned upside down when his childhood friend and lifelong crush, Dee Dee Michaud, comes back to town. Dee Dee was always the town flirt, a beautiful, boisterous girl whose spirit couldn't be contained by such a small community. After high school she'd roared off in a sleek Corvette 'the color of the sun' at the side of Bobby Langford, the kind of guy who looked great behind the wheel of a flashy car. Resettling in Fort Kent years later with her son Trooper--the mysterious Bobby having disappeared long ago--Dee Dee starts a candle-making business and soon acquires an avid local following. But why, in the midst of reunions with old friends and a successful business start-up, does she seem so distant? What secret is she keeping from everyone who holds her dear? In this exquisitely crafted, ultimately uplifting novel, K. C. McKinnon beautifully captures the poignance of growing older, the comforting joys of friendship, and the glories of love in its many guises.""

Liars and Saints,"From Simon and Schuster: ""With her first novel, 'Liars and Saints,' award-winning author Maile Meloy more than delivers on the promise of her highly acclaimed debut story collection, 'Half in Love.'  This richly textured novel tells a story of sex and longing, love and loss, and of the deceit that can lie at the heart of family relationships. Set in California, 'Liars and Saints' follows four generations of the Catholic Santerre family from World War II to the present. In a family driven as much by jealousy and propriety as by love, an unspoken tradition of deceit is passed from generation to generation. When tragedy shatters their precarious domestic lives, it takes astonishing courage and compassion to bring them back together. By turns funny and disturbing, irreverent and profound, 'Liars and Saints' is a masterful display of Maile Meloy's prodigious gifts and of her penetrating insight into an extraordinary American family and into the nature of human love.""","Meloy, Maile",,Simon and Schuster,2003,,English,,,,Book,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/50591256"">50591256</a>",,,,,,,,,,,,260,"New York, New York",,,,,,"<div class=""element-text""><a href=""http://mailemeloy.com/mailemeloy/L%26S.html"">Official website of Maile Meloy</a> <br/><br/> <a href=""http://books.simonandschuster.com/Liars-and-Saints/Maile-Meloy/9780743244350"">http://books.simonandschuster.com/Liars-and-Saints/Maile-Meloy/9780743244350</a> <br/><br/> <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=gT7R23fCCD4C&amp;dq=liars+and+saints,+meloy&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s"">http://books.google.com/books?id=gT7R23fCCD4C&amp;dq=liars+and+saints,+meloy&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s</a> (limited preview available here)</div>",,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/40719b78348bef68dedefbcfbf164efc.jpg,California;Death and Disaster;Family;Fiction and Literature;Literary Works -- Fiction;Religion;Youth,Literary Works | Oeuvres littéraires

Peyton Place,"From Messner Books: ""The story of a repressive New England town known for its high standards of public morality, and the steamy sexual activities that take place behind its bedroom doors. While the town's rigid mores lead to hypocrisy and repression, the earthy characters have an unbelievably high level of sexual functioning. In this environment, Allison McKenzie, a dreamy girl coming to womanhood, must make her way without a father, living with her frigid mother Constance McKenzie.""  From University Press of New England: ""When Grace Metalious's debut novel about the dark underside of a small, respectable New England town was published in 1956, it quickly soared to the top of the bestseller lists. A landmark in twentieth-century American popular culture, 'Peyton Place' spawned a successful feature film and a long-running television series-the first prime-time soap opera.""

He flies to Palm Springs and checks himself into a gay resort, of course.

It will appeal to a wide variety of readers....A coming-of-age story, 'Singing the Vernacular' weaves through the guilt of an adolescent boy who knows he's 'different' and the confusion of a middle-age, closeted man.""

When his young son dies in a freak accident, Gerard struggles to find a reason in the smallest of details, including the scrap of paper containing the Sanskrit alphabet that is found at the site.

Accordion Crimes,"A startlingly inclusive selection of a century's worth of American immigrant vignettes tied together by the movement of a single accordion. For immigration studies, it is a portrayal attentive in sentiment and beckoning in its concern for the new American. For Franco American studies, its chapter, ""Hitchhiking in a Wheelchair"" (p. 145), is startlingly poignant, and touches the reader at the precise point where cultural amnesia begins. For fiction writing, it is a great effort from a wonderful storyteller. Proulx won the 1999 Pulitzer Prize and National Book Award for her novel, ""The Shipping News."" From Simon & Schuster: ""E. Annie Proulx's 'Accordion Crimes' is a masterpiece of storytelling that spans a century and a continent. Proulx brings the immigrant experience in America to life through the eyes of the descendants of Mexicans, Poles, Africans, Irish-Scots, Franco-Canadians and many others, all linked by their successive ownership of a simple green accordion. The music they make is their last link with the past -- voice for their fantasies, sorrows and exuberance. Proulx's prodigious knowledge, unforgettable characters and radiant language make 'Accordion Crimes' a stunning novel, exhilarating in its scope and originality.""

Imperial Conflict,"Third novel in ""Le Québécois"" series. From Artenay Press: ""Three decades of colonial peace and prosperity follow the Treaty of Utrecht. Bastien's three succeeding generations migrate to settle south and west along the Saint Lawrence River, and farther south into the Illinois and Louisiana territories. The abandoned Acadiens manage to retain their neutral status. France constructs the great fortress of Louisbourg to guard its access to the Saint Lawrence River. Britain develops its port in Halifax and increases its military presence in Nova Scotia....Bastien's adult grandchildren marry and establish their own homes and families. French Canadians continue to explore and extend their fur trade. Growth of the English provincial population greatly outpaces that of the French; their traders and settlers begin to migrate west across the Alleghenies. Conflict flares up along the frontiers over territorial claims. The Acadiens are forcibly scattered throughout the English provinces. British and French armed forces arrive in North America.""

As militiamen and voyageurs, their sons and sons-in-law travel thousands of miles inland by way of the western rivers and Great Lakes....During this period of rapid exploration and extension of the Canadian frontiers, a marked increase in fur exports brings great wealth to France. There develops a struggle for control over the western territories, Hudson Bay trading posts, the Newfoundland and Acadian fisheries, pitting English colonies and the five Iroquois nations against Nouvelle France, Acadia, and their native allies.

Papa Martel,"Ten-story chronicle of the fictional Franco-American Martel family in the fictional town of Groveton, Maine, modeled after Lewiston. A touching, funny, and intimate portrayal of family life in the early twentieth century. Most recent version of the text carries an introduction written by Jim Bishop. Honored by the Baxter Society of Portland, Maine, as one of the 100 books best describing Maine's history and people. From a review written by Joe Carr: ""Papa Martel, which was originally published by Doubleday in 1961, is the loosely autobiographical story of a Franco-American family, led by Louis Martel. The story is related through the coming of age of his nine children, from 1919 to 1937, with flashbacks to the youthful premarital years of Louis and his future wife Cecile...Papa Martel, a contract carpenter who travels throughout Maine for work, fills his children with stories of Acadie, their ancestral homeland, in a sense binding his family to the much larger 'family' of French in North America.""

Smouldering Fires,"Young adult novel heavily influenced by the tale of ""Evangeline"" by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. Seton's final novel, originally published in 1975. Republished in 2010.  From Chicago Review Press: ""Anya Seton, whose many novels won her world-wide acclaim, wrote, for her last book, a fast-paced novel that explores the subconscious mind of a young girl whose troubled dream life parallels that of another girl who lived over 200 years earlier....A shy high school senior, Amy Delatour is a misfit in the well-to-do community in which she lives with her widowed mother and French-Canadian grandfather. Amyâ's passion is for the 19th-century poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, whom she sees as a romantic and tragic figure. Her immersion in the poetâ's life and writings is partly fueled by her grandfatherâ's tales of his ancestors and of the injustice of 'le grand dérangement,' when the French Acadians were expelled from their home in Nova Scotia in 1775....Amy has steeped herself in the lore of the period, and the efforts of a young English teacher to draw her out through hypnosis brings unexpected results...""

Duhamel : Ideas of Order in Little Canada,"A book of poems in reflection of the author's hometown, Southbridge, Massachusetts. From Gale Literature: ""Tremblay returned to his mill-town roots with the historical poems in 'Duhamel: Ideas of Order in Little Canada.' Through his evocation of working-class New England in the 1950s, noted Bruce Shlain in his New York Times Book Review critique, the poet 'brings back the sights, smells and emotions of his boyhood.' And in his story of a drunk-and-disorderly artist who rebels against a society that would stifle his impulse, Tremblay, concluded Shlain, 'inspires awe and pity.'""

One Came Back : A Franco-American Civil War Novel,"From Images from the Past: ""The first published translation into English of 'Un Revenant,' an 1884 romantic adventure written by Rémi Tremblay, a French-Canadian author who turned his own experiences as a teenaged enlistee in the Civil War into a story of two fascinating heroes. Tremblay served in the 14th US Regular Infantry, fought in the battles of Spottsylvania Court House, The Wilderness, Cold Harbor, and Petersburg, and was imprisoned in Libby prison. Part autobiography, part melodramatic love story, 'Un Revenant' was one of nine novels by Franco-Americans which were part of the 1975 to 1982 National Materials Development Center publication program. With this meticulous new translation, Tremblay's novel can now be read in either French or English... or side by side.""

Howard's battle against encroaching change symbolizes the class conflict between indigenous Granite Staters scratching out a living and citified immigrants with 'college degrees and big bank accounts.'

"Becoming Cajun, Becoming American : The Acadian in American Literature from Longfellow to James Lee Burke","From LSU Press: ""From antebellum times, Louisianaâ's unique multipartite society included a legal and social space for intermediary racial groups such as Acadians, Creoles, and Creoles of Color. In 'Becoming Cajun, Becoming American,' Maria Hebert-Leiter explores how American writers have portrayed Acadian culture over the past 150 years. Combining a study of Acadian literary history with an examination of Acadian ethnic history in light of recent social theories, she offers insight into the Americanization process experienced by Acadians who over time came to be known as Cajuns during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.""

The Man with the Easel of Horn: The Life and Works of Émile Friant,"From the author: ""This novel can be seen as a companion work to Beaupré's recent publication on Van Gogh. Both are based on the historical and aesthetic facts surrounding the lives of the two artists, Van Gogh in Arles and Friant in the Alsace-Lorraine region, as well as Paris. The novel incorporates the following elements: Friant's many paintings well described, the Parisian ateliers, photography as a tool for painting, the Grand Salon, the literary life of Friant's times, the 1889 World's Fair, and the close relationship with the best French actor of his day, Bernard Coquelin, and the Franco-Prussian War as well as WWI. Moreover, as a novel, we encounter a seduction scene on the part of a young woman, a difficult friendship with an Italian man who tries to teach the artist the notion of sensuousness, the struggle with the concept of infinity on the part of the creative self in èmile Friant, and a professional relationship with the artist, John Singer Sargent.""","Beaupré, Norman",,Llumina Press,2010,,English,,,,Book,,,,,,,,,,,,,378,"Coral Springs, Florida",,,,,,"<div class=""element-text""><a href=""http://www.nrbeaupre.com/writings/easel-of-horn.html"">http://www.nrbeaupre.com/writings/easel-of-horn.html</a></div>",,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/056fe6ac71aad99b2378a4a4af411bb2.jpg,Art and Architecture;Fiction and Literature;France;Literary Works -- Fiction;Personal History: Biography and Oral History,Literary Works | Oeuvres littéraires

"La Souillonne, Deusse: Monologue sur sciène","From the author's website: ""The dramatic monologue, La Souillonne, was such a tremendous success for its author, Norman Beaupré, that it prompted a friend of his to say, 'There must be a follow-up to this.' The author replied that he had not thought about it and that he did not think he had enough material in his creative imagination to write a sequel. However, after seeing the performance of the play twice at the Franco-American Heritage Center in Lewiston and seeing it again in Lamièque, New Brunswick this past summer performed to a sell-out crowd, he began to sift ideas in his mind especially once he heard sea stories by the performer, Marie Cormier's brother, Angelbert Paulin who had caught fish and crabs out in the open seas for some forty years. Beaupré now had at his disposition some materials about Acadians and the sea. He then set out to line up other topics such as, the snoops [les écornifleuses], the famished and the tell-it-alls [les défoncés et les paniers parcés], WWII and the ration [la ration et la guerre], the melting pot, the shoe shops, odd people [les gens de travers], old habits [les accoutumances] and our way of speaking [le parlement de not'e monde].""","Beaupré, Norman",,Llumina Press,2008,,Français,,,,Book,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/251338043"">251338043</a>",,,,,,,,,,,,209,"Coral Springs, Florida",,,9.7816E+12,,,"<div class=""element-text""><a href=""http://www.nrbeaupre.com/writings/la-souillonne-deusse.html"">http://www.nrbeaupre.com/writings/la-souillonne-deusse.html</a> <br/><br/> <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=_oWQPQAACAAJ&amp;dq=beaupre%3B+la+souillonne,+deusse&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=aM6tTKryLIT48Ab95fzdBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA"">La Souillonne, Deusse... sur Google Books</a></div>",,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/d9a6387da2a63f198afc4e0c7f71b10b.jpg,Community: Customs and Social Life;Ethnicity and Collective Identity;Fiction and Literature;Gender and Sexuality;Literary Works -- Fiction;Maine;Mills and Mill Work;Performing Arts,Literary Works | Oeuvres littéraires

The Boy with the Blue Cap : Van Gogh in Arles,"From the author's website: ""Professor Emeritus Beaupré enjoyed teaching world literature and French Impressionism as well as Post-Impressionism during his college career. Over the years, he developed a special liking for Van Gogh, the man, his drawings and his paintings. This novel deals with 73 of Van Goghâ's paintings in Arles as well as in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence. The story is told by a young precocious boy, Camille Roulin, son of the postal worker, Joseph Roulin. Van Gogh painted the portraits of the entire Roulin family while in Arles. The reader is brought into Van Goghâ's world of vibrant color and accomplished artistry by means of a close relationship with a boy who is privileged to follow the artist around in his many excursions throughout the countryside of Arles as well as other places frequented by the artist. The artist at work relates to the boy his techniques and theories on painting and drawing. The novel not only deals with the aesthetic side of Van Gogh but also introduces us to his spiritual side so often neglected by some authors and art critics.""","Beaupré, Norman",,Llumina Press,2008,,English,,,,Book,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/304550258"">304550258</a>",,,,,,,,,,,,290,"Coral Springs, Florida",,,9.78161E+12,,,"<div class=""element-text""><a href=""http://www.nrbeaupre.com/writings/boy-with-blue-cap.html"">http://www.nrbeaupre.com/writings/boy-with-blue-cap.html</a> <br/><br/> <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=4mNhPgAACAAJ&amp;dq=beaupre%3B+the+boy+with+the+blue+cap&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=d82tTPH8NcP98Aax4-jHBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA"">The Boy with the Blue Cap... @ Google Books</a></div>",,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/cad00c80ede4946cf950787157c48486.jpg,Art and Architecture;Fiction and Literature;France;Literary Works -- Fiction;Youth,Literary Works | Oeuvres littéraires
"Trails Within: Meditations on the Walking Trails at the Ghost Ranch in Abiquiu, New Mexico","From the author's website: ""This is essentially a book of reflections on particular ways of seeing things on the three walking trails at the Ghost Ranch [northern New Mexico]. This very popular site is often referred to as Georgia O'Keefe country. The three main components are deadwood, rocks, and desert flowers. A photo that becomes the catalyst for creative reflection accompanies each component text. As the author points out, walking trails, holistically speaking, are the occasions for physical exercise, emotional release, esthetic activity, intellectual operation, and spiritual excursion. The author uses his own experiences with fine arts and his teaching of the humanities to delve into poetic excursions of the without and the within. He employs the word 'soul' to mean the creative power in all of us, potential as well as active.""","Beaupré, Norman",,Llumina Press,2007,,English,,,,Book,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/162131918"">162131918</a>",,,,,,,,,,,,144,"Coral Springs, Florida",,,9.7816E+12,,,"<div class=""element-text""><a href=""http://www.nrbeaupre.com/writings/trails-within.html"">http://www.nrbeaupre.com/writings/trails-within.html</a> <br/><br/> <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=1ZcuIwAACAAJ&amp;dq=beaupre;+trails+within&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6GpITb7LA4fpgAelvYDkBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA"">Trails Within... @ Google Books</a></div>",,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/79471decec2bffd85a9be00766bebcb9.jpg,,Literary Works | Oeuvres littéraires

Lunar Attractions,"From Gale Literature:  ""'Lunar Attractions' (1979) recalls many of the themes and settings of [Blaise's] short stories--the child, David Greenwood, who discovers his French-Canadian ancestry (his real name is Boisvert), the dislocations of life in North America, and the terror that lurks beneath the surface of everyday life (the strange fish that becomes an analogue for his stillborn sister - the high school beauty who is revealed as a transvestite). Autobiographical elements were, once again, noted by reviewers. By this time, however, Blaise seems to have become determined to forestall any easy connections between his own life and the materials of his fiction. He notes, following the acknowledgments, that 'Lunar Attractions' is fiction in the mode of autobiography, but that life was never lived.' The novel was reviewed favorably in Canada, although some commentators found the work melodramatic in places. Books in Canada gave 'Lunar Attractions' its annual award as the best first novel of the year.""

"Au Revoir, L'Acadie","From PublishAmerica:""The Great Depression has dealt the cotton textile industry repeated blows. Mills are failing and unemployment is rampant. Irish and Franco-American workers in the fictional Southeastern New England town of Millbank, Massachusetts, are desperate, but based on years of strife they distrust each other almost as much as they fear management. For decades, the owners have succeeded in keeping labor divided by ancestry. 'Au Revoir, L'Acadie' describes the heroic efforts of working men and women of great character to overcome their long-held prejudices to become workers and Americans instead of merely disgruntled ethnic victims. As working conditions deteriorate and profits disappear, a violent strike ensues and a worker is killed. Labor leaders, management, clergy, and town fathers must find their way back from the abyss of anarchy to save their followers and the town.""

Everything Matters!,"Waterville, Maine, native Ron Currie, Jr.â's sophomore effort, Everything Matters!, is not a story about aliens â€“ although it could be. The voice in Junior Thibodeauâ's head has told him precisely when the world will end. Lecturing robotically to him as he festers aware in the womb, the funny, supportive, but self-consciously standoffish clairvoyant(s) behind Juniorâ's genius goes on to narrate the second-person portion of his life story that Currie writes in all three tenses. Currie and his narrators - human and otherwise - give us entry into the lives of Junior's family and friends who live in a community that could very well be Currie's Waterville, Maine (though the author never says it outright). Many of the elements of Currieâ's characters â€“ stubborn, brusque, fraternal, reverent, prone to drink â€“ share an often untold quality with the characters of many similar New England communities, their roots practically hidden here in plain view except for their attachment to French surnames. But even greater than this, Currieâ's story reminds us of an America that has often done well to mask its strangers, to create a space where the insight provided by an alien voice in oneâ's head might be better lived out in secret, lived out well, than proffered unto disillusionment: a slight against Currieâ's dictum that in spite of the worldâ's end, Everything Matters!","Currie, Ron, Jr.",,Viking Press,2009,,English,,,,Book,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/268957344"">268957344</a>",,,,,,,,,,,,305,"New York, New York",,,,,,"<div class=""element-text""><a href=""http://www.roncurriejr.net/"">http://www.roncurriejr.net/</a> <br/><br/> <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=dOjRPAAACAAJ&amp;dq=everything+matters&amp;cd=1"">Everything Matters! @ Google Books</a></div>",,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/97baf4a6c3860422928d9e4303052723.jpg,Alcohol and Drugs;Death and Disaster;Fairfield ME;Family;Fiction and Literature;Kennebec River Valley;Literary Works -- Fiction;Sports and Leisure;Waterville ME,Literary Works | Oeuvres littéraires
God Is Dead,"A collection of short stories loosely connected, all based on the premise of the death of God. From Viking Press: ""Ron Currie's gutsy, funny book is instantly gripping: If God takes human form and dies, what would become of life as we know it? Effortlessly combining outlandish humor with big questions about mortality, ethics, and human weakness, Ron Currie, Jr., holds a funhouse mirror to our present-day world. God has inhabited the mortal body of a young Dinka woman in the Sudan. When she is killed in the Darfur desert, he dies along with her, and word of his death soon begins to spread. Faced with the hard proof that there is no supreme being in charge, the world is irrevocably transformed, yet remains oddly recognizable.""

With Justice for All : A Three Act Play,"With Justice For All leads its reader through the drama surrounding the potential 1876 eviction of French families from their homes on disputed land in the St. John River Valley of Aroostook County, Maine.  A play in two languages, and a play that illustrates late-nineteenth-century Franco-American bilingualism, it moves from rural family life, to the Maine state legislature, and then to the courthouse in a unique display of the cultural range of the Maine citizenry of that era. By the drama's end, playwright Guy Dubay has made a reassuring claim in defense of the state's judicial system  helping in this instance to protect the rights and traditions of early Franco-American landholders. From the text: ""The State of Maine, in 1868, had deeded a million acres of land, which included the St. John Valley, to the European and North American Railroad (E. & N.A. R.R.). The events in the decade to follow were to involve the Valley farmers in the state's legislative process...Not until 1876, as the nation celebrated its centennial, did one hundred and forty-two families in Madawaska and Frenchville, Maine, receive eviction notices as a result of the impending bankruptcy of the European and North American Railroad. The French-American farmers, practically without formal education, for a time were at the mercy of lawyers and business people who accused Valley settlers with squatting. [SPOILER ALERT!] The drama ended in the State's Supreme Court where the dilemma of these citizens' rights to their property versus wholesale grants of state land to E. & N.A. R.R. was resolved.""","Dubay, Guy F.",,Title VII: Project BRAVE Bulletin,1976,,Français and English,,,,Book,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/2624099"">2624099</a>","1870s, Madawaska, Maine",,,,,,,,,,,73,"Madawaska, Maine",,,,,,"<div class=""element-text"">None</div>",,,,,,Acadians;Aroostook County ME;Family;Farming and Agriculture;Forestry;Government and Politics;Keegan ME;Language and Linguistics;Literary Works -- Drama;Madawaska ME;Social History;St. John River Valley;Van Buren ME,Literary Works | Oeuvres littéraires

Immigrant Odyssey : A French-Canadian Habitant in New England,"Translated and republished autobiography of French-Canadian immigrant to Lowell, Massachusetts, originally made public at the beginning of the 20th century. Introduction written by Frances H. Early. From the book jacket: ""This is the story of a French-Canadian lad who was brought up in poverty and never wanted to abandon his parents and whose conduct and accomplishments have been exemplary.""...""In 1909 Felix Albert, at the age of 64, stood on street corners in Lowell, Massachusetts, hawking for 50 cents what he probably hoped would be a minor bestseller, his own life story, 'Histoire d'un enfant pauvre'....Felix's autobiography was almost lost to our generation. Fortunately, and rather fortuitously, local historian Richard Santerre discovered 'Un enfant pauvre' a few years ago in a Lowell attic, and that copy is at present on deposit at the Boston Public Library.

Un Jacques Cartier errant : trois pieèces ,"Grégoire Chabot's triple collection sits English and French texts face-to-face in a small variety of dramatics and family humor, where characters carry in tow a heavy load of self-pity, but where comedic endings refuse to resign any one of Chabot's dopes to the hellish literary annals of inevitable suffering. The title play of the collection brings sixteenth-century French explorer Jacques Cartier to a nearly empty Franco-American pour-house in a modern mill town, only for the distinguished and costumed guest to find himself in New England  not New France. Chabot's second, 'Chere Maman,' shows us a family of bickering, adult-age children uniting around the 10th anniversary of Maman's death and the 21st birthday of their lone niece, watching family change by the not so dissimilar courses of death and growth. 'Sans Atout,' the third and final piece, places a television at the center of an elderly Franco American couple's Thanksgiving Eve and Day, channeling onto stage not only the burdens that alcohol consumption can place on relationships (or vice versa), but the disconcerting effects of modernity on a family steeped in holiday tradition. All three plays toy heartwarmingly with a barrage of linguistic idiosyncrasies, the sentiments of which are familiar to the many literatures that concern family life in post-immigrant Americana. With a gift for wordplay, Chabot is able to exaggerate smartly the New England French stereotypes about sports, drinking, family, work, and religion to the point that exceeds ridiculousness and becomes  for better or for worse  entirely familiar.","Chabot, Grégoire",,University of Maine Press,1996,,Français and English,,,,Book,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/34983292"">34983292</a>",,,,,,,,,,,,291,"Orono, Maine",,,9.7816E+12,,,"<div class=""element-text""><a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=xejFPAAACAAJ&amp;dq=chabot;+jacques+cartier+discovers+america&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=c4RITfopw9KBB6PN6foF&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA"">Un Jacques Cartier errant...@ Google Books</a></div>",,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/fdf9e70a8dcfe7fe7a0bf4cf27b3fb62.jpg,Acculturation and Assimilation;Alcohol and Drugs;Community: Customs and Social Life;Death and Disaster;Ethnicity and Collective Identity;Family;Fiction and Literature;Illness;Labor History;Language and Linguistics;Literary Works -- Drama;Mills and Mill Work;New England;Performing Arts;Religion;Sports and Leisure,Literary Works | Oeuvres littéraires

Unnatural Deaths,"A crime novel set in a small fictional Maine town. Written by local attorney and resident of Central Maine. From the author's website: ""Why would anyone want to kill Harvey Coburn? This question perplexes Maine state police detective Martin Counihan. Two of Coburn's hunting companions, en route to Coburn's hunting camp deep in the Maine woods, find the owner of Coburn Shoe lying in the woods road with a bullet in his skull. Later that day, the Coburn police discover another body in the parking lot of an Appalachian Trail entry point. This victim is Blackie Pelletier, a worker at Coburn Shoe and the brother of Laurent Pelletier, a powerful, well-connected Maine lawyer. Counihan explores several leads and discovers the startling fact that the murders he is investigating resemble two others, one in Rhode Island and one in Georgia. Is there a link, Counihan wonders.... In a crackling ending, Maine and federal authorities descend on those responsible for these two unusual murders in the small Maine mill town and bring them to justice.""","Fuller, Robert G., Jr.",,Dog Ear Publishing,2009,,English,,,,Book,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/466715527"">466715527</a>",,,,,,,,,,,,220,"Indianapolis, Indiana",,,9.7816E+12,,,"<div class=""element-text""><a href=""http://www.unnaturaldeaths.com/"">http://www.unnaturaldeaths.com/</a> <br/><br/> <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=kzNnylpoojkC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s"">Unnnatural Deaths @ Google Books</a></div>",,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/b214bfd11a8d229d99f5a4e98e3f62c9.jpg,Augusta ME;Brunswick ME;Business and Economics;Community: Customs and Social Life;Death and Disaster;Family;Kennebec River Valley;Labor History;Literary Works -- Fiction;Maine;Mills and Mill Work;Russia;Violence,Literary Works | Oeuvres littéraires

French Connections : A Gathering of Franco-American Poets,"A collection of poetry and essays written by and for Franco America. Varying artistic and literary expressions from writers who share - at least to some degree - in a similar cultural reality. From the editor's website: ""This anthology began with an innuendo: the unnamed advisor to President George W. Bush who was quoted in the New York Times in 2004 as saying of Massachusettsâ' senator John Kerry . . . that Kerry 'looks French.' This was not intended as a compliment....What does it mean to look â€“ or to sound â€“ French...or more specifically, Franco-American? Even just thinking casually about this question highlighted the issue. For the majority of Americans, if the term itself brought any image to mind, it was likely a red-and-white can of bland spaghetti...Why is Franco-American so occult an identity in America?The vision for this anthology was not that it would define Franco-American in any essentialist way and it was not even to collect a group of poems on the theme of French identity. Instead what I had in mind was to bring some measure of visibility to Franco-American through a simple gathering of poets you might well never have thought of holding this particular component of identity in common and letting the poets speak for themselves: in their short bio-essays and in their poems, to provide a forum from which one could hear the wide spectrum of what it might mean to â€œsound French.â€ And that is definitely intended as a compliment, though you may find it means things you didnâ't expect.""","Gelineau, Christine (editor);Bedell, Jack (editor)",,Louisiana Literature Press,2007,,English,,,,Book,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/183201916"">183201916</a>",,,,,,,,,,,,324,"Hammond, Louisiana",,,9.78095E+12,,,"<div class=""element-text""><a href=""http://www.christinegelineau.com/Books/French.htm"">http://www.christinegelineau.com/Books/French.htm</a> <br/><br/> <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=SDXtGQAACAAJ&amp;dq=christine+gelineau;+french+connections&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=xYRJTZqcIYqCsQPFro2TCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA"">French Connections...@ Google Books</a></div>",,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/ce20b6a1bbff74fb85d0d28d647c3866.jpg,Essay;Ethnicity and Collective Identity;Literary Works -- Anthology;Poetry;United States,Literary Works | Oeuvres littéraires

The Mechanization of Motherhood : Images of Maternity in Quebec Women Writers of the Quiet Revolution,"From AmeriQuests: ""In her short story 'Le Peuplement de la Terre' ('Be Fruitful and Multiply') Madeleine Ferron reveals the reality of married life for generations of women in Quebec whose lives were a constant cycle of pregnancy, childbirth and mothering. Like other Quebec women writers, such as Marie Claire Blais and Gabrielle Roy, Ferron turns on its head the myth of the tireless, dutiful and fulfilled mother, happy to serve God and country by producing offspring. All three of these writers depict motherhood in the period prior to the Quiet Revolution with disturbing images of childbearing automats, leaving us not with a glorified and tender view of motherhood, but rather a mechanization of mothering. Could the preponderance of such imagery in the works of women writers of this period point to attitudes in the medical establishment and in the social agenda of the first half of the 20th century? Using Ferron's short story as the primary literary example  with parenthetical references to both Une Saison and Bonheur d'Occasion  I provide historical evidence for the increasingly mechanized nature of mothering in Quebec brought on by the ramping up of social, political, religious and economic pressures placed on women in the first part of the 20th century. The historical evidence will take the form of popular literature of health care professionals in Canada and Quebec during this period, as well as the role of the Cercle de Fermiières, a kind of civic group for rural women of Quebec whose ideology of super-productive women is summed up in their motto, 'Travaillons sans cesse!'

Spoonwood,"The most recent novel in Hebert's acclaimed ""Darby Series,"" depicting realities of family and class in a fictional New Hampshire town. After the death of a young mother in childbirth, and with her wealthy parents seeking custody for the newborn son, a troubled, young working-class father escapes town with his child. From Dartmouth College Press and the University Press of New England: ""After almost fifteen years, Hebert has returned to this rich literary landscape for a new novel of the changing economic and social character of New England. Hebert's previous Darby novel, 'Live Free or Die,' recounted the ill-fated love between Freddie Elman, son of the town trash collector, and Lilith Salmon, child of Upper Darby gentility. At its conclusion, Lilith died giving birth to their son. As Spoonwood opens, Freddie, consumed by grief and anger and struggling with alcoholism, is not prepared to be a father to Birch. But as both his family and Lilith's begin to maneuver for custody of the child, Freddie embarks on a course of action that satisfies none of them. Once again, Hebert masterfully conveys the natural and social landscape of contemporary rural New England. Grounded in complex, fully realized characters, Spoonwood offers Hebert's most optimistic vision yet of acceptance and accommodation across class lines.""","Hebert, Ernest ",,Dartmouth College Press,2005,,English,,,,Book,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/59755997"">59755997</a>",,,,,,,,,,,,320,"Hanover, New Hampshire",,,9.78158E+12,,,"<div class=""element-text""><a href=""http://www.upne.com/1-58465-490-2.html"">http://www.upne.com/1-58465-490-2.html</a> <br/><br/> <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=_2FmmnyLhVwC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s"">Spoonwood @ Google Books</a> (limited preview available) <br/><br/> <a href=""http://www.ybp.com/acad/features/1105_spoonwood.html"">http://www.ybp.com/acad/features/1105_spoonwood.html</a></div>",,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/b427f4dfd7cefa988da95cd3878c3edd.jpg,Alcohol and Drugs;Art and Architecture;Caribou ME;Death and Disaster;Family;Fiction and Literature;Frenchville ME;Keene NH;Killington VT;Literary Works -- Fiction;Maine;New England;New Hampshire;New York NY;Vermont;Youth,Literary Works | Oeuvres littéraires

"Roots Always Precede Routes : On the Road, through a Glass Darkly","Critical reading of Jack Kerouac's most famous novel, ""On the Road,"" through the lens of French mobility in America and Kerouac's Franco American cultural identity. How Kerouac's traveling characters signify and explore the ""homelessness"" that the article's author associates with the French Canadian and Franco American in the United States. From the author: ""This article explores the subterranean layers of 'On the Road,' firstly, approaching them from three perspectives (the dyad routes-roots, ethnogenesis and cultural geography), and secondly, considering the novel within a larger project, the 'Road' project, which allows further insight into the genesis of the 1957 edition and of the original scroll published fifty years later. This article focuses on the relationship between space, identity, travel and nation, and attempts to offer a reading of the authorâ's French-Canadian and Franco-American invisible ethnicity as a guiding line to the 'On the Road' proto-versions and to the themes developed (travel, mapping the land and the quest for the father[land]).""","Pacini, Peggy",Read/Lire: FULL TEXT/TEXTE INTèGRAL,,2011 March 28,,English,,,,Journal Article,,1950s; United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1638-1718,,2,E-rea,"<div class=""element-text""><a href=""http://erea.revues.org/1629"">http://erea.revues.org/1629</a></div>",8,,,,,Canada;Criticism and Review;Emigration and Immigration;Ethnicity and Collective Identity;Family;Fiction and Literature;Geography;Literary Works -- Criticism and History;New England;Québec;Travel and Movement;United States,Literary Works | Oeuvres littéraires
The Questing Beast,"Novel told in parallel stories of a father and son. An American artist's eventual return to Canada in search of an identity in the place of his father's birth and death; the father's youthful departure from Quebec to New England many years before. Each man's personal ""quest"" forward and backward, and the pressures he endures. From McClelland and Stewart: ""'The Questing Beast' traces the lives of a father and son - heirs to a mysterious family disgrace - and their obsessive attempts to appease the specter of their past. Each of them is guided by enigmatic, even mystical, women as their separate journeys take them from the asbestos pits of Thetford Mines, Quebec, to the lush gardens of Miami Beach and, ultimately, back to the same destination.""","Hébert, Richard",,McClelland and Stewart,1984,,English,,,,Book,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/10866546"">10866546</a>",19th century - 20th century; Québec; United States,,,,,,,,,,,363,"Toronto, Ontario",McClelland and Stewart,,9.78077E+12,,,"<div class=""element-text""><a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=LIq2AAAACAAJ&amp;dq=the+questing+beast&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JfgiT9jzN4fj0QHmvvjZCA&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAg"">The Questing Beast @ Google Books</a></div>",,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/d34d50a17a278bbf4db52534233b4e07.jpg,Death and Disaster;Emigration and Immigration;Ethnicity and Collective Identity;Fall River MA;Family;Fiction and Literature;Gender and Sexuality;Hartford CT;Literary Works -- Fiction;Lynn MA;Miami FL;Pawtucket RI;Providence RI;Québec;Taunton MA;United States;Warwick RI;Woonsocket RI,Literary Works | Oeuvres littéraires
