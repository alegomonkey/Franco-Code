In Holyoke, Massachusetts, French-Canadian survivance efforts centered on the education of their children in French-Canadian parish schools however, the parish school performed a dual role for the French Canadians in the context of their cultural transition in New England. French-Canadian culture pervaded the school day with French as a language of instruction, sisters from French-Canadian orders as teachers, religion and Canadian history in the curriculum, and the observance of traditional cultural customs and celebrations. The French-Canadian immigrant community did not anticipate the schools' second role, that of aiding the acculturation of their children into American society. Although these roles seem to be at cross-purposes, they co-existed in New England until the second half of the twentieth century with the weakening of French-Canadian identity, the shortage of teaching sisters, and the closing of ethnic parish schools. The bilingual and bicultural character of the school day, influenced by both assimilation and survivance strategies, contributed to the development of a Franco-American population in Holyoke....""","Fliss, Susan",Preview,,2007,,en,,,,Thesis/Dissertation,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/222290783"">222290783</a>","1880-1920; Holyoke, Massachusetts",,,,,,,,,,,223,"Orono, Maine",,,,,,"<div class=""element-text""><a href=""http://www.library.umaine.edu/theses/theses.asp?highlight=1&amp;Cmd=abstract&amp;ID=HTY2007-008"">Tool of Acculturation...</a> @ Fogler Library, UMaine<br/></div>",,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/b6a32b8f611dc9fb1ca79e145602b188.jpg,Acculturation and Assimilation;Business and Economics;Community: Customs and Social Life;Education;Gender and Sexuality;Holyoke MA;Language and Linguistics;Massachusetts;New England;Nonfiction;Nonfiction -- Education;Nonfiction -- History -- Labor and Social;Québec;Religion,Thèses & Dissertations
"From French Canadian to Franco-American : Cultural Survival and Reinvention of Nationality in a Connecticut Yankee Town, 1855-1895 ","From Fluet: ""This dissertation...focuses on the immigrant French Canadians who maintained their cultural identity and embraced American nationality in the Connecticut Yankee town of Putnam in the period of 1855-1895. Few community studies exist for Connecticut in this period of rapid change and industrialization. Northeastern Connecticut, which witnessed the disappearance of Yankee homogeneity, remains unexamined. Putnam, with its large immigrant population, is representative of the area, and of many other smaller mill towns in the northeastern United States, and permits a glimpse of the process whereby French Canadians became Franco-Americans....Three questions drive the inquiry. The first question involves overarching issues of change and inherent community tensions and problems: how did Putnam move from a Connecticut Yankee town to a diverse city? Second, how did the immigrant French Canadians maintain their mentality of la survivance while participating in debates critical to the development of the Putnam community? Third, how did the French Canadian presence in Putnam help to broaden the very meaning of what it meant to be American in the mind of the community?""","Fluet, Gregoire J.",,,2002,,en,,,,Thesis/Dissertation,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/56843683"">56843683</a>","1855-1895; Putnam, Connecticut",,,,,,,,,,,454,"Worcester, Massachusetts",,,,,,"<div class=""element-text""><a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=PgQynQEACAAJ"">From French Canadian to Franco-American...</a> @ Google Books</div>",,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/fbc884126b61d00ecdfbafe552019832.jpg,Acculturation and Assimilation;Brooklyn CT;Community: Customs and Social Life;Connecticut;Criticism and Review;Emigration and Immigration;Ethnicity and Collective Identity;Government and Politics;Labor History;Language and Linguistics;Mills and Mill Work;New England;Nonfiction;Nonfiction -- History -- Labor and Social;Putnam CT,Thèses & Dissertations

"Tradition and Change in the Gilded Age : Political History of Massachusetts, 1879-1893 ","Massachusetts politics during fifteen years within the industrial and early immigration periods of the late 19th century. From Harmond: ""As this study seeks to show, Massachusetts confronted a dual set of challenges in the post-Reconstruction era.  In the first place, the Irish-Americans and workingmen, provoked by their marginal status, united in a political revolt to obtain greater recognition and benefits for themselves.  From 1878 to 1883 this ethnic-labor insurrection, led by Benjamin F. Butler, was the focus of Massachusetts politics....Secondly, the accelerated tempo of industrial and technological change spawnwed a spirirt of on-rushing materialism which threatened the Commonwealth's traditional business and political mores.  Investors in the newly-developed water gas process, and the electric trolley, for example, resorted to extensive lobbying to secure favors from the legislature.  One result was a series of scandals in the middle and later 1880s endangering the state's relatively high level of public morality....On the whole, Massachusetts met these challenges well. Under the leadership of members of the Yankee establishment, a conservative, but realistic, attempt was made to accomodate the needs of a new day to the Bay State's intellectual and political heritage.""","Harmond, Richard Peter",,,1966,,en,,,,Thesis/Dissertation,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/36608666"">36608666</a>",1879-1893; Massachusetts,,,,,,,,,,,411,"New York, New York",,,,,,"<div class=""element-text""><a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=I0B6twAACAAJ"">Tradition and Change...</a> @ Google Books</div>",,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/ebadb2a85efb3cd3ad1a49c31e828ad6.jpg,Emigration and Immigration;Ethnicity and Collective Identity;Government and Politics;Journalism;Labor History;Massachusetts;Mills and Mill Work;Nonfiction;Nonfiction -- Government and Politics;Nonfiction -- History -- Labor and Social;Social History,Thèses & Dissertations

Phonological Variables in a New England French Speech Community ,"From the author: ""The first section of the present study consists of a historical survey of the Franco-American community, examining those factors, such as the existence of a network of bilingual parochial schools, which were significant for language maintenance efforts. It is observed that French/English bilingualism in New England has seriously declined in the last twenty years, and that organized attempts to provide for its survival are now limited primarily to the state of Maine. The second section of this study specifies the lexical, morphological and syntactic characteristics which distinguish New England French (NEF) from Standard French (SF), based on a corpus of written and oral documents of recent origin. The results obtained are compared with those reported in studies of Canadian French, and in earlier studies of NEF. It is shown that no structural innovations have emerged in NEF which are not also attested in Canadian and other popular varieties of French. The influence of English is primarily restricted to the borrowing of words, but the use of anglicisms is often subject to ridicule. Systematic change in NEF tends to be in the direction of convergence with SF. Synchronically, a continuum of speech style is observed, whose lower or informal levels are characterized by features shared with the French of rural Québec, and whose higher or more formal levels are characterized by corresponding features of SF....The third section consists of an analysis of the present state of the phonology of NEF, and is based on a corpus collected in interviews with six informants in Manchester, New Hampshire. Sixteen phonological rules are formulated, defining elements which distinguish NEF from SF. It is shown that some of these features are being lost as NEF incorporates standard elements. Many of these elements which are avoided in formal speech situations by speakers with more exposure to SF, however, tend to occur frequently or predominantly in less formal situations. The sixteen phonological processes are subjected to partial ordering in terms of an implicational scale, according to whether they are more or less resistant to change. It is shown that those processes which entail only superficial (phonetic) differences between NEF and SF are more likely to be retained, while those processes which entail underlying (morphophonemic) differences are more likely to be lost.""","Kelley, Henry Edward",,,1980,,en; fr,,,,Thesis/Dissertation,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/13275797"">13275797</a>","1970-1980; Manchester, New Hampshire",,,,,,,,,,,222,"Ithaca, New York",,,,,,"<div class=""element-text""><a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=Fu7jAAAAMAAJ"">Phonological Variables in a New England French Speech Community</a> @ Google Books</div>",,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/225a5cb1240880b3a93cd2c4ae14e9a6.jpg,Acculturation and Assimilation;Brunswick ME;Caribou ME;Education;Fall River MA;Language and Linguistics;Lewiston ME;Louisiana;Lowell MA;Maine;Manchester NH;New Bedford MA;New England;New Hampshire;Nonfiction;Nonfiction -- Language and Linguistics;Québec;Salem MA;St. John River Valley;Woonsocket RI;Worcester MA,Thèses & Dissertations

"La migration des Canadiens français vers le Michigan, 1840-1914 : leur contribution au développement socioéconomique de la région","Ce texte a devenu le livre ""Le Canadiens français du Michigan"" (2000), ou ""The French Canadians of Michigan"" (2003). Du résumé: ""Cette thièse a pour objet la migration des Canadiens français vers le Michigan de 1840 à  1914. Elle s'intéresse de maniére plus precise aux Canadiens français qui se sont dirigés vers deux régions caracteristiques du développement industriel de l'Etat, soit la vallée forestiière de la riviere Saginaw et la peninsule miniière de cuivre de Keweenaw. Au-dela d'établir un profil statistique du mouvement migratoire, cette these cherche a mettre en lumiere la contribution des Canadiens français au développement socioéconomique du Michigan, à  connaitre de quelle facon les Canadiens français se sont adaptés à  la realité industrielle changeante du Michigan et à  identifier les strategies qui furent adoptées pour y parvenir....Nous posons d'abord comme cadre general d'analyse que la mobilite spatiale des Canadiens français sur le continent nord-americain a été sous-estimée et que cet aspect de la realité socioéconomique et culturelle des Canadiens français commence à  peine à  être révelé dans toute sa dimension. L'analyse de leur migration vers le Michigan éclaire de maniière encore plus évidente cet aspect et permet d'inscrire ce mouvement migratoire en parfaite continuité avec la culture de mouvement et de travail qu'ils ont acquisé au fil de leur expérience de vie et de travail sur le continent. Nous avons d'abord constaté que les Canadiens français ont contribué de façon marquée à  toutes les étapes du développement socioéconomique et politique du Michigan. Nous avons découvert que l'adaptation des Canadiens français à  la realité industrielle au Michigan s'est exprimée de maniière différente dans le marche du travail forestier et dans celui du travail minier. Dans le premier cas, la culture de mouvement, conjuguée à  une longue expérience de travail dans ce domaine, a fait en sorte que les Canadiens français se sont sentis rapidement à  l'aise dans ce milieu et que cette confiance a influencé leur comportement. Que ce soit dans leur communauté, face à  leurs élites ou au sein du marche du travail, l'assurance qu'ont affichée les Canadiens français leur a permis de prendre une distance face aux préscriptions clericales visant la survivance et l'isolement, pour participer activement à  la société globale, s'y impliquer, s'adapter et réagir aux changements majeurs qui sont survenus sur le marche du travail industriel....Dans le secteur minier, l'absence d'expérience de travail des premiers migrants ne leur a pas permis d'afficher une aussi belle assurance. Les Canadiens français sont démeurés en marge du travail minier alors qu'ils se sont concentrés dans les secteurs connexés du travail forestier pour lequel ils avaient une expérience de travail. Ils ont également cherché à  s'isoler socialement se concentrant dans des villages comme celui de Lake Linden ù ils ont constitué longtemps plus de la moitié de la population totale et ù ils ont pu ainsi maintenir un certain controle sur leur réalité socioéconomique et politique....Mais dans les deux cas, les Canadiens français n'ont pas été passifs, ni victimes de la situation. Aux changements de toute nature qui se sont produits, ils ont constamment réagi en faisant appel à  leur culture de vie et de travail et aus ressources familiales pour s'adapter afin de faciliter leur integration socioéconomique.""","Lamarre, Jean",,,1996,,fr,,,,Thesis/Dissertation,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/46524973"">46524973</a>",1840-1914; Michigan,,,,,,,,,,,521,,,,,,,"<div class=""element-text""><a href=""http://atrium.umontreal.ca/notice/dedupmrg100609282"">La migration...</a> @ l'Université de Montréal</div>;<div class=""element-text""><a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=KEUJPwAACAAJ"">La migration...</a> sur Google Books</div>",,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/fc379e325837a7e5ee3c339405f9716c.jpg,Business and Economics;Demography;Emigration and Immigration;Ethnicity and Collective Identity;Farming and Agriculture;Forestry;Fur-trading;Geography;Government and Politics;Labor History;Michigan;Nonfiction;Nonfiction -- History -- Economic and Industrial;Nonfiction -- History -- Labor and Social;Social History,Thèses & Dissertations
"Franco-American Folk Traditions and Popular Culture in a Former Milltown : Aspects of Ethnic Urban Folklore and the Dynamics of Folklore Change in Lowell, Massachusetts ","From Lane: ""Being Americans of French-Canadian descent, the Franco-Americans of New England possess a rich and original traditional culture which has been little documented up to now, especially in English....As a result, this dissertation, which is a study in ethnic folklore and popular culture, attempts to provide an overview of the folk-traditions of French expression still existing today among the Franco-American community of Lowell, Massachusetts....This work is basically divided into two parts. The first two chapters of Part I deal with the general historical and cultural background of the Franco-Americans of New England, in general, and Lowell, in particular, while the third chapter looks at previous research in the domain of ethnic folklore and, more specifically, Franco-American folklore. Aspects of folklore performance and context are considered from the historical point of view of the Lowell Franco-American community....Part II, on the other hand, deals mainly with the documentation of the various realms of Franco-American folk-traditions, here classified according to genre. Traditional narratives (""contes""), popular jokes (""histoires droles""), children's songs and rhymes, and elements of oral history as well as aspects of traditional singing, music and dance are consecutively considered with sample texts of each genre given and analyzed. Further supporting documents are also presented in the appendices....Because Franco-American culture (and therefore Franco-American folklore and popular culture) is the historical result of successive migrations (from France to what is known today as Canada and, from Canada to New England) this study also takes into account the phenomenon of cultural continuity as well as some aspects of the dynamics of culture change which are viewed here as a process resulting from the conflict having taken and still taking place between two opposing forces: cultural maintenance and assimilation....Most of all, however, this work is a first step into the field of Franco-American oral-traditional genres, popular culture and an homage to ethnic creativity.""","Lane, Brigitte Marie",,,1983,,en,,,,Thesis/Dissertation,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/21874384"">21874384</a>","1830-1980; Lowell, Massachusetts",,,,,,,,,,,608,"Cambridge,  Massachusetts",,,,,,"<div class=""element-text""><a href=""http://hollis.harvard.edu/?itemid=|library/m/aleph|001194917"">Franco-American Folk Traditions...</a> @ Harvard University</div>;<div class=""element-text""><a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=37HYAAAAMAAJ"">Franco-American Folk Traditions...</a> @ Google Books</div>",,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/9541bc86f74a7782d7bdf2e70a6f3e0a.jpg,Acculturation and Assimilation;Bedford NH;Burlington VT;Canada;Community: Customs and Social Life;Emigration and Immigration;Folklore;France;Lowell MA;Manchester NH;Massachusetts;New Brunswick;New England;Nonfiction -- Anthropology;Nonfiction -- Social Sciences;Personal History: Biography and Oral History;Social History;Woonsocket RI,Thèses & Dissertations

L'heritage franco-américain dans le Maine,"De l'introduction de cet étudiant de France: ""Afin d'approcher le sujet, trois méthodes ont été employées. La lecture de documents écrits retracent l'immigration et l'installation de canadiens français dans le Maine. Afin de mieux percevoir ce qui peut définier un franco-américain, l'outil statistique constatera certains critières économiques comme familiaux en 1990. Enfin, différentes rencontres imageront l'environnement d'un franco-américain dans le Maine en cette fin de siiècle....Bien sur, à  travers des traits historiques, on obervera la continuité de quelques formes communautaires encore marquées du seau du XIXième et du début du XXième siiècle.

British and Canadian Immigration to the United States since 1920 ,"Dissertation on the ""invisible immigrants"" to the United States from Britain and Canada between the 1920s and 1960s. From the author: ""Always among the most numerous groups of immigrants to the United States, until 1969, the British and Canadians seldom claimed the attention of historians, just as they caused little discussion among the American people generally. Sharing a common language and closeness of culture with the Americans, the British and Canadians remained unhyphenated--they were America's 'invisible immigrants.'...A number of important studies on the British immigrant, if not the Canadian, do exist, but they are concerned with the Britons' experiences and their contribution to the American mosaic during America's 'century of immigration,' the one hundred years from 1815 to 1914. The purpose of this study was to extend the record of British and Canadian immigration beyond the statistical reports of government departments since the hiatus of World War I and to present an interpretive commentary on the significance of these two streams of immigration--to the sending countries; to the receiving country; and to a sample of individual immigrants themselves.""","Lines, Kenneth",Full text,,1977,,en,,,,Thesis/Dissertation,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/4232362"">4232362</a>",1920-1970; Canada; Great Britain; United States,,,,,,,,,,,234,"Manoa, Hawaii",,,,,,"<div class=""element-text"">&lt;a href=""http://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10125/9870/1/uhm_phd_7723488_r.pdf""&gt;British and Canadian Immigration...&lt;/a&gt; @ University of Hawai'i at Manoa</div>",,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/0ca54a1708e959521ed89e2dc21ce62c.jpg,Business and Economics;Canada;Demography;Emigration and Immigration;Ethnicity and Collective Identity;Great Britain;Labor History;Nonfiction;Nonfiction -- History -- Labor and Social;Nonfiction -- Immigration;Personal History: Biography and Oral History;United States,Thèses & Dissertations

Following the Evangeline Trail : Acadian Identity Performance Across Borders ,"From the author: ""The poem 'Evangeline: A Tale of Acadie' by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow published in 1847, has had an impact on people for generations. The success of the poem was felt not only by its readership but also by the Acadian culture that the poem, and its heroine, came to represent. Evangeline, as character and poem, has evolved in meaning and popularity over the centuries and still plays a role in the cultural performance of contemporary Acadians....This study of Acadian cultural identity utilizes a performance approach that looks at cultural identity as a performative accomplishment in daily life. The analysis first enacts a performance historiography of the Acadian Deportation in 1755, Longfellow's poetic representation of this historical event, and the contemporary context of performing Evangeline in the Acadian diaspora. Next it examines the storytelling performances of narrative interviews with five Acadians. Three of these Acadians still live in the land of Evangeline, in Grand-Pre, Nova Scotia, and the other two live in Maine. Retellings of the story of Evangeline and reflections on the poem and character by each of the participants were analyzed for meanings which form and inform contemporary performances of Acadian cultural identity. The performance methodology allows for meanings to emerge from the embodied Acadian storytelling and to contextualize them in cultural and political spheres....""","Pidacks, Adrienne Marie",Preview,,2008-08-00,,en,,,,Thesis/Dissertation,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/314172114"">314172114</a>",1755-2008; Maine; New Brunswick; Nova Scotia,,,,,,,,,,,175,"Orono, Maine",,,,,,"<div class=""element-text""><a href=""http://www.library.umaine.edu/theses/pdf/PidacksMP2008.pdf"">http://www.library.umaine.edu/theses/pdf/PidacksMP2008.pdf</a> (full text available here)</div>",,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/50575067f284b9fbbffb22797af8fdd2.jpg,Acadians;Aroostook County ME;Ethnicity and Collective Identity;Folklore;Maine;Nonfiction;Nonfiction -- Historiography;Nonfiction -- Social Sciences;Nova Scotia;Performing Arts;Personal History: Biography and Oral History;Poetry;Prince Edward Island,Thèses & Dissertations
"The Status of French Among Youth in a Bilingual American-Canadian Border Community : The Case of Madawaska, Maine ","From Price: ""This study examines the status of the French language among young residents of Madawaska, Maine, a US-Canadian border community with a long history of bilingualism and contact with French speakers. This study views language status as having two distinct yet interrelated components: (1) code role, or characteristics associated with the use of a given language or variety, such as attitudes of speakers toward the variety and its use, the proficiency level of speakers, language use patterns, and so forth, and (2) code nature, or the state of the variety in question in terms of syntax, phonology and lexicon. The data, collected by means of four interview tasks, targeted both code role and code nature and sought to determine the general status of French among the younger residents of this community. In addition to the younger subject population, a small adult baseline population was also included in order to compare data across generations, so as to identify not just possible differences in code role, but also in code nature, including the possibility of language loss....The data suggested several trends. First, in terms of code role, young subjects generally reported lower levels of language use, proficiency and exposure to French than did adults. Secondly, not only did high-proficiency young subjects generally report higher scores in these areas than did lower-proficiency subjects, but males tended to score higher than females in this regard. This would suggest that exposure to French, context, language proficiency and gender correlate with language use among this population. Conversely, attitudes do not generally appear to be a salient factor motivating French language use. With regard to code nature, the study found that even the most proficient young speakers demonstrated some important gaps in their grammatical competence, and that the young subject population as a whole exhibited features in their production consistent with language loss. The study concludes that although there are still many individuals with ability in French, the differences between younger and older speakers in terms of both code role and code nature suggest that local French will be lost unless further action is taken to reverse the progress of French language loss among young bilinguals in the community.""","Price, Joseph Edward",Preview,,2007,,en; fr,,,,Thesis/Dissertation,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/256913741"">256913741</a>","20th century-21st century; Madawaska, Maine",,,,,,,,,,,493,"Bloomington, Indiana",,,,,,"<div class=""element-text""><a href=""http://books.google.com/books?isbn=0549442774"">The Status of French...</a> @ Google Books</div>",,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/030d2a3384fb730d6a6110c92869b065.jpg,Acadians;Acculturation and Assimilation;Aroostook County ME;Community: Customs and Social Life;Demography;Ethnicity and Collective Identity;Family;Fort Kent ME;Frenchville ME;Gender and Sexuality;Geography;Language and Linguistics;Madawaska ME;New Brunswick;New England;Nonfiction;Nonfiction -- Language and Linguistics;Personal History: Biography and Oral History;Québec;St. John River Valley,Thèses & Dissertations
"From Canadien to American : The Acculturation of French-Canadian Descendants in Lewiston, Maine, 1860 to the Present ","Dissertation from the author of ""Loyal but French: The Negotiation of Identity by French-Canadian Descendants in the United States."" From the author: ""Using Lewiston, Maine, as a community study, this dissertation examines how individuals of French-Canadian descent negotiated their entry into U.S. society from 1860 to 2001. Descriptive statistics compiled from federal manuscript censuses, city directories, and naturalization records provide portraits of the community at different points in time. The French language newspaper of Lewiston and materials from Catholic archives provide much of the literary evidence in this work....This study challenges our understanding of what we call ""assimilation."" It suggests that acculturation rather than ""assimilation"" better describes the process by which ethnic populations join the host society. Historians tend to oversimplify ethnic preservation and acculturation by depicting them as binary opposites. This study argues that, rather than struggling between ethnic retention and acculturation, French-Canadian migrants and their Franco-American descendants in Lewiston pursued them as intertwined goals from the 1870s to the 1950s. It also contends that their Americanization was anything but linear. Lewiston's francophones challenged, rejected, or redefined some of the norms of the host society, as they renegotiated their identity in the United States. Yet, modeling good citizenship was integral to their interconnected identity as ethnic Americans. The experiences of Lewiston's French-Canadian descendants challenge contemporary assumptions about the incompatibility of ethnic retention and Americanization.""","Richard, Mark Paul",,,2001,,en,,,,Thesis/Dissertation,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/48260966"">48260966</a>","1860-2000; Lewiston, Maine",,,,,,,,,,,583,"Durham, North Carolina",,,,,,"<div class=""element-text""><a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=gdN9NAEACAAJ"">From Canadien to American...</a> @ Google Books</div>",,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/f3177e396cd172ff9722121c0ee614d5.jpg,Acculturation and Assimilation;Auburn ME;Community: Customs and Social Life;Emigration and Immigration;Ethnicity and Collective Identity;Government and Politics;Journalism;Labor History;Lewiston ME;Mills and Mill Work;Nonfiction;Nonfiction -- History -- Labor and Social;Religion;Social History,Thèses & Dissertations
"Exploration of Immigration, Industrialization, and Ethnicity in Waterville, Maine ","From Rowe: ""This paper traces how hegemonic forces create boundaries through the specific examples of the Lebanese and Franco-Americans in Waterville, Maine. These two immigrant groups entered into Waterville after an English-Scottish Protestant majority had already been established in the eighteenth and early nineteenth century. The Franco-American immigration from Quebec extended well over a century and the flow of people out of Canada can generally be studied into two distinct waves. People were constantly coming into Waterville from Quebec, and a small number would return to live in Canada after a time. It is also critical to understand that Franco-Americans were settling all over Maine during this same time span and that it is generally accepted that in the state of Maine today at least forty percent of the state has French-Canadian ancestry. In contrast the Lebanese who came to Waterville came during a very specific time period, from about 1890-1920. Their numbers were smaller and there were very few Lebanese who settled elsewhere in Maine.""","Rowe, Amy E.",Full text,,1999,,en,,,,Thesis/Dissertation,"<a href=""http://digitalcommons.colby.edu/honorstheses/215/"">215</a>","1830-1990; Waterville, Maine",,,,,,,,,,,,"Waterville, Maine",,,,,,"<div class=""element-text""><a href=""http://digitalcommons.colby.edu/honorstheses/215/"">Exploration of Immigration...</a> @ Colby College</div>",,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/119542006bc686192c50327440934a55.jpg,Community: Customs and Social Life;Emigration and Immigration;Ethnicity and Collective Identity;Kennebec River Valley;Labor History;Lebanese Americans;Maine;Mills and Mill Work;Nonfiction;Nonfiction -- Anthropology;Nonfiction -- History -- Labor and Social;Nonfiction -- Immigration;Nonfiction -- Social Sciences;Québec;Social History;Waterville ME,Thèses & Dissertations
Economic Factors in the Persistence of French-Canadian Identity in New England,"From Schulz: ""French-Canadian immigrants to New England, unlike other ethnic groups in the United States, did not show signs of assimilation into American society until the 1950's. This thesis examines the history of one French-Canadian community - Sand Hill, in Augusta, Maine. French Canadians came to Augusta in great numbers around the turn of the century to work in the cotton mill. To investigate the retention of French-Canadian identity, French-Canadian immigrants are considered as both an ethnic group and a social class. Evidence drawn from interviews with immigrants and from written accounts shows that economic conditions, such as poverty and lack of education, helped to reinforce French-Canadian isolation from ""Yankees"" in Augusta. Resistance to assimilation was also promoted by policies and informal practices of two strong local institutions: the French Catholic Church and the textile mill.""

"Living Arrangements : Race, Ethnicity and Nationality in the Liberal State ","From the author: ""Liberals usually argue that cultural identity can flourish in the private sphere but should not matter in public. This argument is blind to the way liberal institutions affect cultural identity, the prejudices that members of some groups face, and the need for there to be only one or two public languages in most modern states. To fill this gap in liberal theory, I divide cultural groups into three: racial, ethnic and national groups. I explore this gap by looking at four groups: American Jews, the Amish, Black Americans and French Canadians....I argue that liberal citizenship transforms ethnic identity, making it difficult though not impossible to maintain strong ethnic ties in the liberal state. I defend these effects on ethnic identity, though I also argue that there is often too much pressure on ethnics to give up their particular practices. Liberal citizenship, though, has not transformed the identity of the Amish, who maintain their identity through a voluntary radical separation from the rest of society. The Amish treasure hierarchical and patriarchal illiberal values, but liberal toleration means that the liberal state should do little about this. Black Americans also have a distinctive culture, not from voluntary separation, but as a consequence of racism. For Blacks to gain equal citizenship, the liberal state must work to make Black citizenship visible and allow Blacks to bypass the effects of racism. This is contrary to the usual liberal argument of making issues of identity private matters. If Blacks gain liberal citizenship their identity would change considerably, just as liberal citizenship has transformed ethnic identity....Many people claim their cultural identity is tied to a particular language, yet most languages have a hard time surviving in industrialized, liberal states. I explain the conditions that languages need to survive. I contend, paradoxically, that because liberalism transforms ethnic identity, liberalism increases the importance of language to the identity of some. While liberalism and nationalism are usually antagonistic, I sketch out a compromise between language-based nationalism and liberalism. I end the dissertation by pointing out the implications my argument has for educational policy and for liberal theory.""","Spinner, Jeffrey Alan",,,1992,,en,,,,Thesis/Dissertation,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/30073134"">30073134</a>",20th century; United States,,,,,,,,,,,338,"Ann Arbor, Michigan",,,,,,"<div class=""element-text""><a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=hV8eAQAAMAAJ"">Living Arrangements...</a> @ Google Books</div>",,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/f653586b50156be2ff7245b49fbfbf9b.jpg,Acculturation and Assimilation;African Americans;Canada;Ethnicity and Collective Identity;Government and Politics;Jewish Americans;Language and Linguistics;Nonfiction;Nonfiction -- Government and Politics;Religion;United States,Thèses & Dissertations
Morphosyntactic Variation and Language Shift in Two Franco-American Communities ,"From the author: ""Although the originally French speaking Franco-American communities of Southbridge, Massachusetts, and Woonsocket, Rhode Island, have much in common historically, language shift toward English has advanced to differing degrees in the two locations. In this dissertation, I explore morphosyntactic variation and the advance of language shift in the two locations using historical documentation, U.S. census figures and sociolinguistic interviews conducted with sixty-nine informants....After comparing and contrasting the sociolinguistic profiles of the two communities, I describe some of the linguistic consequences of the shift from French to English in these traditional Franco-American centers through a quantitative variationist analysis of two morphosyntactic variables. These are auxiliary variation in the passé composé and variation between use of the synthetic and analytic futures.

"Migration, Family, and Gender : A Longitudinal Analysis of French-Canadian Immigrants in Lowell, Massachussetts, 1900-1920 ","From Takai: ""'Migration, Family, and Gender: A Longitudinal Study of French-Canadian Immigrants in Lowell , Massachusetts , 1900-1920,' explores migration from French Canada to a New England urban centre of the textile industry, Lowell, Massachusetts. During the period under study, both Québec and New England underwent significant socioeconomic transformation. This work analyses the impact of these changes on the process of migration and settlement. It also sheds light on the diverse ways in which French-Canadian men, women, and children responded to new realities in an urban industrial society. In order to investigate these issues, it is necessary to consider this migration as a phenomenon which consisted of a series of processes and not as a linear progression towards inevitable assimilation or Americanization. It is also crucial to emphasize the importance of introducing a gendered perspective in order to recognize the diversity of strategies devised by immigrant men and women as well as the cooperation and tensions they experienced in the process of migration and settlement....This thesis joins recent scholarship in criticizing a perspective that has described all immigrant behaviour as necessarily reflecting one set of culturally predetermined norms and customs. Contrary to the stereotyped image of French Canadians as immobile and fatalistic habitants, evidence from this study shows that they were a highly mobile people for whom migration was a pondered response to the structural changes that were radically reshaping Québec and New England societies. It is argued that the behaviour of Lowell's French-Canadian immigrants in the early twentieth century did not merely reflect the cultural transplantation of habitant values, but also the attempts of working-class immigrant families to survive and cope with significant socioeconomic transformation occurring to both Québec and New England. The diversity in the recorded patterns of movements on the part of French Canadians is indicative of their strategic autonomy and flexibility in adjusting to new socioeconomic realities....This study also seeks to redress a major gender imbalance in the historical studies of immigrants by devoting considerable attention to women. Not only did women's lives differ from those of their male counterparts; there was also great variation in the extent to which women assumed financial and domestic tasks. Such diversity, I assert, in the patterns of women's paid work was defined not only by age or marital status, but also by a combination of factors such as household organization, living arrangements, and the availability of child care. Immigrant families harboured complex interpersonal dynamics where different and, at times, conflicting interests had to be negotiated in not necessarily equal terms, but in accordance to each member's power and authority within the family and the larger society.""","Takai, Yukari",,,1999,,en,,,,Thesis/Dissertation,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/46428729"">46428729</a>","1900-1920; Lowell, Massachusetts",,,,,,,,,,,332,"Montréal, Québec",,,,,,"<div class=""element-text""><a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=yRq4NwAACAAJ"">Migration, Family and Gender...</a> @ Google Books</div>",,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/59757db746a7c63599acdaed3805b6fc.jpg,Acculturation and Assimilation;Business and Economics;Community: Customs and Social Life;Death and Disaster;Demography;Emigration and Immigration;Ethnicity and Collective Identity;Family;Gender and Sexuality;Geography;Illness;Labor History;Lowell MA;Massachusetts;Mills and Mill Work;New England;Nonfiction;Nonfiction -- History -- Labor and Social;Nonfiction -- Immigration;Québec;Social History;St. Lawrence River Valley,Thèses & Dissertations

Le concept de communauté en géographie vu à  travers le petit Québec de la Floride,"Le résumé de Tremblay: ""Dans cette these de doctorat, nous explorons le concept de communauté, lequel appartient à  la sociologie mais qui est d'un grand intéret pour les géographes par sa dimension spatiale plutot méconnue.  Ce que nous cherchons  à  mieux connaitre c'est le role des lieux dans la vie quotidienne des membres d'une communauté en banlieue....Dans un premier temps, nous montrons la pertinence d'utliser l'approche sociogéographique pour étudier la communauté. Ensuite, nous traitons de concept de communauté et des multiples mutations qu'il a connues depuis une centaine d'années. Cette partie de la these permet également à  constater que, comme le propose le géographe R.J. Johnston (1993), il y a un rapprochement entre le concept d'espace social de la geographe Anne Buttimer et celui de communauté....Dans la seconde moitié de notre these, nous appliquons notre réflexion à  une étude de cas, c'est- à -dire l'espace canadien-francais en ballieue de Miami, que nous appelons ici ""Floribec"". A partir d'observations de terrain, réunies dans un chapitre qui offre une vision de l'extérieur de la géographie de Floribec, nous nous posons les questions suivantes. Quels sont les institutions et les lieux structurants floribécois et quel role jouent-ils dans leur vie quotidienne de cette communauté? Aussi, comment Floribec est-elle organisée spatialement? Par la suite nous devoilons une vision de l'intérieur de la géographie de Floribec et ce, à  partir des résultats d'une enquete réalisée aupres de commercants floribécois....Cette étude de cas permet non seulement de révéler l'organisation spatiale de Floribec, mais aussi de suggérer qu'une communauté se structure à  partir d'un ensemble de lieux structurants dont certains éloignées, qui lui donnent sa cohérence, et d'ou la communauté tire son identité.""","Tremblay, Remy",Texte intégral,,2000,,fr,,,,Thesis/Dissertation,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/50754742"">50754742</a>",20e siiècle; Floride,,,,,,,,,,,297,"Ottawa, Ontario",,,,,,"<div class=""element-text""><a href=""http://www.nlc-bnc.ca/obj/s4/f2/dsk1/tape4/PQDD_0019/NQ57072.pdf"">Le concept de communauté...</a> @ Library and Archives Canada</div>;<div class=""element-text""><a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=aee6SgAACAAJ"">Le concept de communauté...</a> sur Google Books</div>",,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/77d2ae6d5ecf95333385fd4f37f3d9f3.jpg,Canada;Community: Customs and Social Life;Demography;Emigration and Immigration;Florida;France;Geography;Great Britain;Hollywood FL;Miami FL;Nonfiction;Nonfiction -- Geography;Québec;United States,Thèses & Dissertations

"Postcolonialism in North America : Imaginative Colonization in Henry Thoreau's ""A Yankee in Canada"" and Jacques Poulin's ""Volkswagen Blues""","Also featured, in abridged form, in the Massachusetts Review (see 'Journal Articles'). From the author: ""This thesis introduces the concept of imaginative colonization in postcolonial literary and cultural studies, which has a particular relevance to the literatures of North America. It argues that the postcolonial experiences of the former colonies of England and France in the Americas, particularly the United States and French Canada, have been primarily conditioned by their relations to each other and not by their relations to the former colonizing power. Imaginative colonization occurs when one former colony, using the means of the cross-border narrative and/or the postmodern recuperation of history, reimagines another not as an autonomous cultural entity, but as a feature of its own history, language, ideology, and even cartography. Focusing especially on Henry Thoreau's travelogue, 'A Yankee in Canada' (1866) and Jacques Poulin's postmodern novel, 'Volkswagen Blues' (1984), but taking into account the entire history of French Canadian-American relations, this thesis establishes that the practice of imaginative colonization in North American literatures is parallel but nonsynchronous: both American and French Canadian literature go through the same developmental stages of decolonization and postcolonial imaginative colonization, even though they do so in different centuries. The examples presented also indicate that imaginative colonization blurs the established dividing lines between works of fact and fiction and that it occurs in both French and English.""","Weisman, Adam",,,1995,,en,,,,Thesis/Dissertation,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/34361480"">34361480</a>",1750-1995; Canada; United States,,,,,,,,,,,263,"Cambridge, Massachusetts",,,,,,"<div class=""element-text""><a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=73eUHAAACAAJ"">Postcolonialism in North America...</a> @ Google Books</div>",,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/5b9b9ef0d052c665f9ec7bd8db718961.jpg,Canada;Criticism and Review;England;Ethnicity and Collective Identity;Fiction and Literature;France;Government and Politics;Literary Works;Literary Works -- Criticism and History;Québec;United States,Thèses & Dissertations

The Role of Fr. Jean-Baptiste Proulx in the Danielson Affair and in the Manitoba School Question,"From the author: ""The thesis is an examination of the role of Fr. Jean-Baptiste Proulx as an intermediary for the French-Canadian laity at St. James' Church in Danielson, Connecticut in the parish discord known as the Danielson Affair, and as a secret ambassador of Prime Minister Wilfred Laurier for negotiations with Pope Leo XIII in order to settle the Manitoba School Question in 1896. The thesis re-examines the histories that have been written about Fr. Proulx's role in both historical events, and the histories that are examined are the book and dissertation by Sr. Dolores Liptak, European Immigrants and the Catholic Church in Connecticut, 1870-1920, and Robert Rumilly's Histoire des Franco-Américains and volumes eight and nine of his series, Histoire de la Province du Québec. ... The sources that are used to re-examine the histories are sources that Robert Rumilly used, such as the Papers of Fr. Proulx that are held by the National Archives of Quebec at Montreal, as well as Fr. Proulx's own account as an intermediary in the Danielson Affair, entitled: ""Journal of My Steps and Walks in the Diocese of Hartford on the Subject of Danielson by the Reverend J.B. Proulx, Parish Priest of St. Lin."" Also used are several contemporary newspapers in Connecticut, as well as three French-language newspapers that were published in Montreal and in Southern New England. In the analysis of the Danielson Affair and the Manitoba School Question, the thesis examines the development of several documents in light of either historical event. ... Also, the thesis analyzes two speeches from the Eleventh Convention of the Canadiens-Américains du Connecticut that was held in September 1896, and how they became two documents about the Danielson Affair that were forwarded to Fr. Proulx while he was in Rome. Other documents that are examined are the decision of the Connecticut Supreme Court of Errors on the contested election of lay trustees at St. James' Church in Danielson, known as 'State ex rel. George Barry vs. Eli Getty and James Reynolds,' and the response by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Hartford to the said decision that changed the state laws for the incorporation of Catholic parishes, 'An Act concerning the Organization of Roman Catholic Churches' in 1903.""","Marceau, Albert J.

The Need for Bilingual Education in the Schools of Vermont,"Argument toward implementing a bilingual education program in the public schools of the state of Vermont. Written in the context of the 1968 United States congressional discussions about funding bilingual education in general, and the scope of languages to which congress would propose attention. Uses Vermont as a case study in language demographics. Presents the author's collection of data concerning Vermont language usage, geographic distribution of children with limited English-speaking ability, and other factors pertinent to the federal legislation in question. While the dissertation engages bilingual education as a national phenomenon involving many languages other than English, the specific case of Vermont orientates the author toward the language realities of that state, the bulk of non-English speakers being represented in populations of French-speaking Franco Americans there. Contains an overview of scholarship on bilingualism.

Becoming Holy in Early Canada : Performance and the Making of Holy Persons in Society and Culture,"From the author: ""In this dissertation, I analyze how local religious figures became holy and the social functions they played, in order to better understand the connections between religion and colonialism and the shaping of faith communities over time. The study covers a broad time period from the early days of French settlement in Canada to the late nineteenth century. The focus falls on New France and the holy persons associated with the early years of settlement when religion and colonization were intimately connected. It was only towards the end of the nineteenth century that these figures were put forward for official recognition by the church in canonization causes, and consequently I conclude the study with an examination of the processes and resulting documents that contributed to the transformation of local holy persons into saints. Throughout the study, I concentrate on the place holy persons occupied in local society both during life and after death as intercessors for the faithful, the meanings they held and presented to their audiences, and the ways they performed the traditions of sanctity. Rituals of holiness were a form of communication. Holy persons and audiences interacted with and influenced one another to create a saint that was efficacious and effective. While faith communities developed around local, family and community networks, hagiographic texts described the lives, deaths and intercessions of select individuals and spread cults of belief. Between performances of holiness and the inscription of holy lives into texts, local saints were made who responded to the needs of their faith communities and became important parts of local religious, social, and cultural life.""","Pearson, Timothy G.

A Geography of the Imaginary : Mapping Francophone Identities and Curriculum Perspectives in the Postcolonial Present,"From the author: ""In the province of Alberta, the recent phenomenon of French-speaking newcomers, who are multicultural, multiracial, multiethnic and multifaith, is putting into question the concept of a collective Francophone identity in Canada. On the one hand, the notion of a collective Francophone identity has been evolving for several decades. On the other, changing demographics are challenging the already elusive concept of Francophone identity across Canada, thus making the notion increasingly difficult to define. The question therefore remains: who is Francophone in Canada?...As a Francophone teacher-researcher in a minority setting, I am particularly drawn to explore how Grade 7 students perceive and construct the francophonie and their Francophone identity as lived in Alberta. Specifically, I consider how stories of history, memory, language and geography explore the lived experience of Francophones in Alberta, especially during an era of increasing pluralism...""","Thompson, Laura Anne ",Full text,,2008,,en; fr,,,,Thesis/Dissertation,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/229425429"">229425429</a>",21st century; Alberta,,,,,,English and français,,,,,391,"Edmonton, Alberta",,,,,,"<div class=""element-text""><a href=""http://books.google.com/books?isbn=0494456167"">A Geography of the Imaginary...</a> @ Google Books</div>;<div class=""element-text""><a href=""http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/thesescanada/vol2/002/NR45616.PDF"">A Geography of the Imaginary...</a> @ Library and Archives Canada</div>",,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/cd514f4cf02e351db300618d91d8b4d5.jpg,Acculturation and Assimilation;Alberta;Canada;Community: Customs and Social Life;Education;Ethnicity and Collective Identity;Geography;Government and Politics;Language and Linguistics;Nonfiction;Nonfiction -- Education;Nonfiction -- French in North America;Religion,Thèses & Dissertations

In this dissertation, I argue that cultural identity does continue in spite of language loss and that when language loss does occur, other identity traits, such as festivals and traditional celebrations take on a more profound and visible role in order to maintain this cultural identity.

""In 2006 and 2007, I observed the Guiannée (La Guiannée) of Sainte Genevieve, Missouri, and of Prairie du Rocher, Illinois, to understand how these two communities continue to express the culture of their French heritage. The Guiannée became the center of my research into understanding the maintenance of the Franco-American identity.

Southern Seduction : Canadian and American Snowbirds in Florida Since 1945,"From the author: ""This thesis explains and analyzes the phenomenon of seasonal, long-term winter travel to Florida, travelers that South Floridians have called 'snowbirds.' It demonstrates what pushed and pulled [Canadian and American] snowbirds to Florida, analyzes their journey south, their settlement patterns and housing choices, their tendency to congregate together, the forms of their sociability. It mostly defines snowbirds as migrants who, down South, build communities of kindred spirits. In the fragmented built landscape of 20th-century Florida, the congregation of snowbirds produced unique forms of socialization and, we argue, of community. These unique settlements have uniquely influenced Floridians' debates about their own community-building issue, while playing a part in Northerners' views about Florida, the South, the North, the United States and Canada.""","Desrosiers-Lauzon, Godefroy",Full text,,2008,,en,,,,Thesis/Dissertation,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/658153238"">658153238</a>",1945-2008; Florida,,,,,,,,,,,467,"Ottawa, Ontario",,,,,,"<div class=""element-text""><a href=""http://hdl.handle.net/10393/29718"">Southern Seduction...</a> @ uOttawa</div>;<div class=""element-text""><a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=plyYYgEACAAJ"">Southern Seduction...</a> @ Google Books</div>",,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/319070ee2ff301ecb10786c3f565c80e.jpg,Acculturation and Assimilation;Business and Economics;Canada;Chicago IL;Community: Customs and Social Life;Emigration and Immigration;Ethnicity and Collective Identity;Florida;Geography;Government and Politics;Hollywood FL;Miami FL;Montréal QC;New York;Nonfiction;Nonfiction -- History -- Labor and Social;Nonfiction -- Travel and Tourism;Québec;Social History;Sports and Leisure;St. Petersburg FL;Travel and Movement;United States,Thèses & Dissertations

"Family, Kinship and Community Formation on the Canadian-American Border : Madawaska, 1785-1842","From the author: ""The Madawaska settlement, on the Upper St. John Valley in Northern Maine and North West New Brunswick was started in 1785 by a group of Acadian and French-Canadian families for New Brunswick, and a group of French Canadians from the St. Lawrence Valley. They were subsequently joined by other migrants from French Canada. The settlers lived off subsistence farming till 1824, when lumbercamps opened in the region. They were isolated as no road connected the Upper St. John Valley with other settled region until the 1830s. The only means of communication between Madawaska and the outside world was through the St. John and Madawaska Rivers and through portages to the St. Lawrence. This study examines the interaction between family, kinship networks and the process of community formation over the first sixty years of this settlement. It is based primarily on quantitative sources: parish registers, censuses, land records, but also uses existing traditional evidence. Consequently, it extensively uses quantitative and demographic techniques.""","Craig, Béatrice (Chevalier)",,,1983,,en,,,,Thesis,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/52377703"">52377703</a>","1785-1842; Madawaska, Maine; New Brunswick",,,,,,,,,,,227,"Orono, Maine",,,,,,"<div class=""element-text""><a href=""http://www.library.umaine.edu/theses/theses.asp?Cmd=abstract&amp;ID=HTY1983-001"">Family, Kinship and Community...</a> @ Fogler Library, UMaine</div>",,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/377b91e88b982dd69b15e1af9732525c.jpg,Acadians;Aroostook County ME;Community: Customs and Social Life;Demography;Emigration and Immigration;Ethnicity and Collective Identity;Family;Farming and Agriculture;Geography;Labor History;Language and Linguistics;Madawaska ME;Native Americans;New Brunswick;Nonfiction;Nonfiction -- French in North America;Nonfiction -- History -- Labor and Social;Religion;Social History;St. John River Valley,Thèses & Dissertations
