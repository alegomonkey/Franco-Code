"Companions of Champlain : Founding Families of Québec, 1608-1635","A remembrance of the French colonists to accompany explorer Samuel de Champlain to North America in the seventeenth century, and some observations on the particular developments of their transplanted culture and society. The first decades of the French in North America, and an historical context for the French in Canada. Provides genealogical information on these early colonists and their families. Appended with maps, images, references, and lineages.   From the author:  ""Companions of Champlain: Founding Families of Quebec, 1608-1635, was produced to honor the 400th anniversary of the founding of Québec City and to enable North Americans on both sides of the political divide to appreciate more fully their French-Canadian heritage.  ""Companions of Champlain explains in clear language the reasons for the New-World explorations of Samuel de Champlain in the 1600s and the unique culture that resulted from the establishment of a trading post in the wilds of North America in 1608. ""Appendices provide an alphabetical list of French genealogical terminology and an example of citation notation for use when filling in ancestral charts, one of which is provided for reproduction. The full-reference citation method described in the book is unique in that it is keyed from the numbering sequence on commonly used charts and does not require the superscripts and complex systems often found in genealogy.  ""Included in the volume are maps, an illustration of Champlainâ's 1603 astrolabe, references, five appendices, lineage and pedigree charts with citations, and an index.""","Larson, Denise R.",,Clearfield Company (Genealogical Publishing Company),2008,,English,,,,Book,"<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/192139891"">192139891</a>","1608-1635, Québec",,,,,,,,,,,178,,,,9.78081E+12,,,"<div class=""element-text""><a href=""http://minerva.maine.edu/search~S29?/tcompanions+of+champlain/tcompanions+of+champlain/-3,0,0,B/partninn@http://mainecat.maine.edu&amp;backlink=/search~S29?/tcompanions+of+champlain/tcompanions+of+champlain/-3%2C0%2C0%2CB/browse/indexsort=-"">Companions of Champlain... @ Minerva</a> <br/><br/> <a href=""http://www.genealogical.com/products/Companions%20of%20Champlain%20Founding%20Families%20of%20Quebec%201608%201635/9914.html"">Companions of Champlain... @ Genealogical Publishing Company</a> <br/><br/> <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=6Q5w2x5r45wC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s"">Companions of Champlain... @ Google Books</a></div>",,,,,https://francolibrary.com/archive/files/7fa8bc50382decf2dd23c2e205420467.jpg,Canada;Ethnicity and Collective Identity;Exploration and Colonization;Farming and Agriculture;France;Genealogy;Geography;North America;Québec,Contributions
